# Deployment Status Monitoring System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive deployment status monitoring system for Phase 3 Task 3.1 of the SAMS deployment automation. The system provides real-time monitoring, deployment tracking, and rollback capabilities.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Vercel Monitor (`src/monitors/vercel-monitor.ts`)
A robust monitoring system that polls Vercel API for deployment status updates.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time deployment status polling (every 2 seconds by default)
- Visual progress bars with percentage indicators using ora
- Deployment state tracking: QUEUED → BUILDING → UPLOADING → DEPLOYING → READY
- Timeout handling with configurable duration (default: 10 minutes)
- Error detection and reporting
- Deployment URL extraction and validation
- Latest deployment retrieval for projects

**Methods:**
- `monitorDeployment(deploymentId, options)` - Monitor a specific deployment
- `getLatestDeployment(projectId, token)` - Get latest deployment for a project
- `extractDeploymentId(url)` - Extract deployment ID from Vercel URL

### 2. Deployment Tracker (`src/monitors/deployment-tracker.ts`)
Persistent storage and management of deployment history for rollback functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Deployment metadata storage with Git information
- Deployment history tracking with filtering by component/environment
- Success/failure rate statistics
- Rollback candidate identification
- Data export capabilities (JSON/CSV formats)
- Automatic cleanup of old deployments
- Deployment duration and performance tracking

**Methods:**
- `recordDeployment(result, metadata)` - Record new deployment
- `getDeploymentHistory(component, env, limit)` - Retrieve filtered history
- `getRollbackCandidate(component, env)` - Find previous successful deployment
- `getStatistics(component, env, days)` - Calculate deployment metrics
- `cleanup(daysToKeep)` - Remove old deployment records

### 3. Base Deployer Integration (`src/deployers/base.ts`)
Enhanced the base deployer class to integrate monitoring capabilities.

**Enhancements:**
- Automatic monitoring when `--monitor` flag is set
- Deployment tracking for all successful and failed deployments
- Git metadata collection (commit hash, branch, user)
- Version information tracking
- Statistics display after deployments

### 4. Command Line Interface (`src/commands/`)

#### History Command (`src/commands/history.ts`)
```bash
sams-deploy history [options]
```
**Options:**
- `-c, --component <component>` - Filter by component
- `-e, --env <environment>` - Filter by environment  
- `-l, --limit <number>` - Number of records to show
- `--export <file>` - Export history to file
- `--stats` - Show deployment statistics
- `--cleanup <days>` - Clean up old records

#### Rollback Command (`src/commands/rollback.ts`)
```bash
sams-deploy rollback <component> <environment> [options]
```
**Options:**
- `--to <deploymentId>` - Specific deployment to rollback to
- `--dry-run` - Preview rollback without executing
- `--force` - Skip confirmation
- `--monitor` - Monitor rollback progress

## Integration Points

### 1. Monitoring Flag Integration
When the `--monitor` flag is set during deployment:
1. Deployment executes normally through Vercel CLI
2. Monitor extracts deployment ID from URL
3. Real-time polling begins showing progress
4. Success/failure state is verified
5. Deployment metadata is recorded

### 2. Git Information Collection
Automatically collects:
- Current commit hash
- Current branch name
- User who initiated deployment
- Version information from shared/version.json

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful timeout handling with user-friendly messages
- API error recovery with retry logic
- Non-blocking failure recording (monitoring failure doesn't fail deployment)
- Comprehensive error messages with hints for resolution

## Usage Examples

### Basic Deployment with Monitoring
```bash
sams-deploy --env production --component mobile --monitor
```

### View Deployment History
```bash
sams-deploy history --component mobile --env production --limit 5
```

### Rollback to Previous Deployment
```bash
sams-deploy rollback mobile production --monitor
```

### Export Deployment Statistics
```bash
sams-deploy history --stats --component mobile
sams-deploy history --export deployments.csv
```

## Configuration

### Timeouts
- Default poll interval: 2 seconds
- Default timeout: 10 minutes (configurable via `--timeout`)
- API call timeout: 30 seconds with 3 retries

### Storage
- Deployment history stored in `~/.sams/deployment-history.json`
- Maximum history size: 100 deployments (configurable)
- Automatic cleanup after 90 days

### Progress Display
- Visual progress bar with filled/empty indicators
- Percentage completion display
- Real-time status messages
- Color-coded success/failure indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
- **ora**: Spinner and progress bar management
- **chalk**: Colored terminal output
- **commander**: CLI argument parsing
- **zod**: Type validation (existing)

### Architecture Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different monitors for different platforms
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time status updates
- **Repository Pattern**: Deployment history storage
- **Command Pattern**: CLI command structure

### Error Recovery
- Exponential backoff for API calls
- Graceful degradation when monitoring fails
- Clear error messages with actionable hints
- Non-destructive failure handling
