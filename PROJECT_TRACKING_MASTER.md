## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (3 Open)

### MEDIUM-001: Dates from Frontend UI need to be normalized to America/Cancun
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üî¥ OPEN
- **Description**: When entering 1/1/2025 late in the evening, the date gets sent to the controller as 12/31/2024. We have fixed this before by implementing timezone utilities in timezone.js but in the refactor, new data entry (Add Expense, for example) is writing the date as one day earlier and the quick filter commands in Transactions (This Month, for example) are also off on their start and end dates for the filter.
- **Impact**: Production Blocker
- **Task ID**: ISSUE-20250729_2222
- **Location**: `issues/open/ISSUE_DATES_FROM_FRONTEND_UI_NEED_TO_BE_NORMALIZED_TO_AMERICA/CANCUN_20250729_2222.md`

### MEDIUM-002: Need to create propertyAccess MAP when adding a new client and/or user update
- **Module**: User Management
- **Status**: üî¥ OPEN
- **Description**: Creating a new user does not grant anyone access via the propertyAccess check thus blocking writes to the db even as a superAdmin.
- **Impact**: Non-production blocker
- **Task ID**: ISSUE-20250731_2127
- **Location**: `issues/open/ISSUE_NEED_TO_CREATE_PROPERTYACCESS_MAP_WHEN_ADDING_A_NEW_CLIENT_AND/OR_USER_UPDATE_20250731_2127.md`

### MEDIUM-003: Add Expense Modal Filter Active Payment Methods
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop - Transaction Entry
- **Status**: üî¥ OPEN
- **Description**: Add Expense modal shows all payment methods regardless of status, should filter for active only (like HOA Dues modal)
- **Impact**: User confusion, potential selection of inactive payment methods
- **Task ID**: ISSUE-20250730_1630
- **Location**: `issues/open/ISSUE_ADD_EXPENSE_FILTER_ACTIVE_PAYMENT_METHODS_20250730_1630.md`

## üöÄ ENHANCEMENTS

### ENHANCEMENT-001: List Management for Accounts
- **Module**: UI/UX
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **User Story**: We need to ability to edit the accounts list. The data collection is created during import onboarding but we do not have a list management function to edit it.
- **Business Value**: Complete CRUD functionality for financial accounts
- **Effort**: üü¢ Small (1-2 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250707_1323
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_LIST_MANAGEMENT_FOR_ACCOUNTS_20250707_1323.md`

- **Description**: Re-add Unit Report to Mobile Admin/SuperAdmin interface
- **Task ID**: MOB-UNIT-REPORT-001

### ENHANCEMENT-004: Mobile HOA Payment Module for Admin
- **Module**: Frontend Mobile - HOA Management
- **Status**: üîµ BACKLOG
- **Description**: Create mobile HOA payment module for Admin/SuperAdmin
- **Task ID**: MOB-HOA-ADMIN-001

### ENHANCEMENT-005: Advanced Reporting Dashboard
- **Module**: Frontend - Analytics
- **Status**: üîµ BACKLOG
- **Description**: Create advanced analytics and reporting dashboard
- **Task ID**: ANALYTICS-DASH-001

### ENHANCEMENT-006: Mobile App Offline Support
- **Module**: Mobile
- **Status**: üîµ BACKLOG
- **Description**: Comprehensive user activity audit logging
- **Task ID**: AUDIT-LOG-001

### ENHANCEMENT-007: Task Management System
- **Module**: Backend
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **User Story**: We need a system to maintain repeatable and/or schedulable tasks. Examples are "Log Water Meter Readings on the last work day of each month" and "Change the cistern water filter every 6 months". Another, different example would be connected to HOA Dues and Special Assessments. "Send email follow up to all units who have not paid their monthly dues on the 10th day of the new month and add x% penalty". "Contact Special Assessment #30 Contractor for project status 30 days after project start". The TMS should be able to be "attached" to different documents in our DB (HOA Dues Payment, Projects, etc). The TMS should provide basic ToDo list functionality on its own when not connected to another module. "Change water filter" task is an example of a disconnected task.
- **Business Value**: Ensure tasks and projects are completed and that payments are made and received.
- **Effort**: üü† Large (1-3 days)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250802_1904
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_TASK_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM_20250802_1904.md`

- **Status**: üîµ BACKLOG
- **Description**: Add Spanish language support for MTC operations
- **Priority**: Future Development
- **Task ID**: MULTI-LANG-001

### ENHANCEMENT-010: HOA Collection Rate Celebration
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop - Dashboard
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üéâ FUN
- **User Story**: Add confetti animation when HOA collection rate reaches 100%
- **Business Value**: Gamification to encourage timely payments
- **Effort**: üü¢ Small (1-2 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250728-CONFETTI
- **Location**: Future enhancement discussed July 28, 2025

### ENHANCEMENT-011: Unit Management Dues Field Migration
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop - Unit Management
- **Status**: üü° TODO
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **Description**: Migrate dues field from duesAmount to scheduledAmount in Unit Management
- **Business Value**: Field naming consistency across the application
- **Effort**: üü¢ Small (1-2 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250728-DUES-FIELD
- **Location**: Identified during HOA transaction work

### ENHANCEMENT-012: AVII Water Bills
- **Module**: Financial Operations
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üî• HIGH
- **User Story**: The AVII (Aventuras Villas II) client has a unique situation with regard to water bills. Each unit pays for their own water usage based on their own meter readings. The water bill is very straightforward -- new meter reading minus previous meter reading times 50 pesos is the bill without taxes or other charges. There is an extra component for washing cars (100 pesos per wash) and boats (200 pesos per wash). We need a tool in SAMS to accept meter readings per unit, compare to previous meter readings, allow for car and boat washes then generate a digital request for payment to be emailed to the unit's email addresses. Payments will be tracked similar to HOA Dues with a grid of who has paid, who hasn't and the penalties of 5% per month after 10 days of non-payment. The payment will log as a transaction the same way HOA Dues payments are logged with cross-reference and notes.
- **Business Value**: Small peso amounts but monthly and with penalties tied to late payments means this has to be efficient and easy to use.
- **Effort**: üü° Medium (3-8 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250731_1510
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_AV-II_WATER_BILLS_20250731_1510.md`

### ENHANCEMENT-013: Activity-Based Meter Reading Modules
- **Module**: New Activities (Water Consumption, Propane Monitoring)
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üî• HIGH
- **User Story**: Create individual Activity modules for client-specific needs: Water Consumption (AVII) for monthly water billing, and Propane Monitoring (MTC) for tank level notifications. Each activity will be enabled through the existing config/activities system.
- **Business Value**: 
  - Automate monthly water billing for AVII (~$50,000 MXN/month revenue)
  - Improve safety with propane level monitoring for MTC
  - Reduce manual work and errors in billing calculations
  - Enable future client-specific activities (EV Charging, Parking, etc.)
- **New Activities**:
  1. **Water Consumption** (AVII): Meter readings ‚Üí consumption calc ‚Üí bills ‚Üí payments ‚Üí receipts
  2. **Propane Monitoring** (MTC): Tank levels ‚Üí gauge visualizations ‚Üí notifications
- **Shared Components**:
  - Staff user type for field data entry
  - Reading entry interface (configurable per activity)
  - Historical data storage and trending
  - Email notification system
  - Payment tracking grid (for billing activities)
- **Effort**: üü† Large (3-5 weeks)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250803-ACTIVITY-MODULES
- **Design Documents**: 
  - Original: `/apm/memory/enhancements/SPECIAL_BILLINGS_MODULE_DESIGN.md`
  - Updated: `/apm/memory/enhancements/ACTIVITY_BASED_MODULES_DESIGN.md`
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Task Management System (ENH-20250802_1904) for scheduling
  - Fiscal Year Support completion for AVII
  - Existing config/activities system

### ENHANCEMENT-014: HOA Dues and Special Billings Autopay from Credit Balance
- **Module**: Backend
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **User Story**: Upon loading or as a nightly scheduled task, any unit that is past due in their HOA and/or Special Billings (for example, water consumption bill) that has sufficient credit balance to cover a full payment should have that payment made and credit balance reduced accordingly. This will require comprehensive notes within the transaction, an automated Digital Receipt sent to the owner and property manager and some form of notification to the administrators and superAdmins for verification and confirmation after the fact.
- **Business Value**: Avoid Late Fees while credit balances exist.
- **Effort**: üü° Medium (3-8 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250804_2206
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_HOA_DUES_AND_SPECIAL_BILLINGS_AUTOPAY_FROM_CREDIT_BALANCE_20250804_2206.md`

### ENHANCEMENT-015: Dues Payments on different schedules (monthly vs quarterly)
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üöÄ FUTURE
- **User Story**: The AVII client pays their HOA dues quarterly. We are talking about the minimum amount due. Any owner can overpay or advance pay but each client will have a minimum payment period. Most will be monthly (MTC) but some (AVII) have a required quarterly (3 months) payment. The enhancement would work with the new Fiscal Year handling to determine HOA payment status and Past Due amounts for the dashboard and reports. The data would still be stored and shown in monthly increments but the logic and language would change for reports and notifications to require full period (quarterly) payments.
- **Business Value**: More accurate client communications
- **Effort**: üü† Large (1-3 days)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250804_2222
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_DUES_PAYMENTS_ON_DIFFERENT_SCHEDULES_(MONTHLY_VS_QUARTERLY)_20250804_2222.md`

### ENH-0806: Exchange Rate trend graph
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üöÄ FUTURE
- **User Story**: Using our historical exchangeRates create a trend graph for the trailing 6 months showing USD vs MXP.  The first phase can use just 6 months and just USD hardcoded.  A future phase could add user-selected periods and currencies.  The graph will be used on both desktop UI and mobile app when the Exchange Rates dashboard card is clicked or tapped.  On the mobile-app that tap currently brings up the calculator so we will have to detail with the UI/UX for that.
- **Business Value**: Visual representation of the user's expenses and deposit exchange rates.
- **Effort**: üü° Medium (3-8 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250806_1644
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_EXCHANGE_RATE_TREND_GRAPH_20250806_1644.md`

### NEW-0807: Client Logos and Icons are not appearing
- **Module**: Document Management
- **Status**: üî¥ OPEN
- **Description**: When we upload icon and logo images via the Edit Client modal, the files get uploaded to the bucket but are not callled in for the model itself of the Client Selector.\n
- **Impact**: Poor User Experience
- **Task ID**: ISSUE-20250807_1450
- **Location**: `issues/open/ISSUE_CLIENT_LOGOS_AND_ICONS_ARE_NOT_APPEARING_20250807_1450.md`

### ENH-0901: Universal Configuration Editor needed
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **User Story**: We have a ton of fields in the /clients/:clientId/config collection that are unique to each client.  Each document has many fields that are used throughout the code.  We should ccreate a generalized view and edit function inside of Settings that just lists all collections then all documents then all fields recursively.  We will never know what config data each client has but we need to allow an Admin to edit them for data-driven functions.
- **Business Value**: Maintenance of Clients requires this.
- **Effort**: üü† Large (1-3 days)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250901_1405
