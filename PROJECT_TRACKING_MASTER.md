## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (2 Open)

### MEDIUM-001: Dates from Frontend UI need to be normalized to America/Cancun
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: When entering 1/1/2025 late in the evening, the date gets sent to the controller as 12/31/2024. We have fixed this before by implementing timezone utilities in timezone.js but in the refactor, new data entry (Add Expense, for example) is writing the date as one day earlier and the quick filter commands in Transactions (This Month, for example) are also off on their start and end dates for the filter.
- **Impact**: Production Blocker
- **Task ID**: ISSUE-20250729_2222
- **Resolved**: October 8, 2025 (again)

### MEDIUM-002: Need to create propertyAccess MAP when adding a new client and/or user update

### ENHANCEMENT-014: HOA Dues and Special Billings Autopay from Credit Balance
- **Module**: Backend
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **User Story**: Upon loading or as a nightly scheduled task, any unit that is past due in their HOA and/or Special Billings (for example, water consumption bill) that has sufficient credit balance to cover a full payment should have that payment made and credit balance reduced accordingly. This will require comprehensive notes within the transaction, an automated Digital Receipt sent to the owner and property manager and some form of notification to the administrators and superAdmins for verification and confirmation after the fact.
- **Business Value**: Avoid Late Fees while credit balances exist.
- **Effort**: üü° Medium (3-8 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250804_2206
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_HOA_DUES_AND_SPECIAL_BILLINGS_AUTOPAY_FROM_CREDIT_BALANCE_20250804_2206.md`

### ENHANCEMENT-015: Dues Payments on different schedules (monthly vs quarterly)
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üöÄ FUTURE
- **User Story**: The AVII client pays their HOA dues quarterly. We are talking about the minimum amount due. Any owner can overpay or advance pay but each client will have a minimum payment period. Most will be monthly (MTC) but some (AVII) have a required quarterly (3 months) payment. The enhancement would work with the new Fiscal Year handling to determine HOA payment status and Past Due amounts for the dashboard and reports. The data would still be stored and shown in monthly increments but the logic and language would change for reports and notifications to require full period (quarterly) payments.
- **Business Value**: More accurate client communications
- **Effort**: üü† Large (1-3 days)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250804_2222
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_DUES_PAYMENTS_ON_DIFFERENT_SCHEDULES_(MONTHLY_VS_QUARTERLY)_20250804_2222.md`

### ENH-0806: Exchange Rate trend graph
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: üöÄ FUTURE
- **User Story**: Using our historical exchangeRates create a trend graph for the trailing 6 months showing USD vs MXP.  The first phase can use just 6 months and just USD hardcoded.  A future phase could add user-selected periods and currencies.  The graph will be used on both desktop UI and mobile app when the Exchange Rates dashboard card is clicked or tapped.  On the mobile-app that tap currently brings up the calculator so we will have to detail with the UI/UX for that.
- **Business Value**: Visual representation of the user's expenses and deposit exchange rates.
- **Effort**: üü° Medium (3-8 hours)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250806_1644
- **Location**: `enhancements/ENHANCEMENT_EXCHANGE_RATE_TREND_GRAPH_20250806_1644.md`

### NEW-0807: Client Logos and Icons are not appearing
- **Module**: Document Management
- **Status**: üî¥ OPEN
- **Description**: When we upload icon and logo images via the Edit Client modal, the files get uploaded to the bucket but are not callled in for the model itself of the Client Selector.\n
- **Impact**: Poor User Experience
- **Task ID**: ISSUE-20250807_1450
- **Location**: `issues/open/ISSUE_CLIENT_LOGOS_AND_ICONS_ARE_NOT_APPEARING_20250807_1450.md`

### ENH-0901: Universal Configuration Editor needed
- **Module**: Frontend Desktop
- **Status**: üìã BACKLOG
- **Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- **User Story**: We have a ton of fields in the /clients/:clientId/config collection that are unique to each client.  Each document has many fields that are used throughout the code.  We should ccreate a generalized view and edit function inside of Settings that just lists all collections then all documents then all fields recursively.  We will never know what config data each client has but we need to allow an Admin to edit them for data-driven functions.
- **Business Value**: Maintenance of Clients requires this.
- **Effort**: üü† Large (1-3 days)
- **Task ID**: ENH-20250901_1405

## üìä TECHNICAL DEBT

### **TD-018: Water Bills - Surgical Update Penalty Calculation**
**Category:** Water Bills - Financial Accuracy  
**Priority:** üî• High  
**Created:** October 18, 2025  
**Context:** Surgical updates may not trigger penalty recalculation

**Description:**
Surgical updates after water bill payments may not be running penalty recalculation, which is necessary for partial payments and proper penalty updates. This could cause stale penalty amounts to display after payments.

**Current Impact:**
- **Potential financial accuracy issue** - Partial payments may show incorrect penalties
- Overdue amounts may not update properly after payments
- displayDue, displayPenalties, displayOverdue may be stale

**Investigation Required:**
- Does `waterDataService.updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()` call penalty recalculation?
- Are penalties updated for partial payments?
- Silent failures in penalty calculation?

**Code Locations:**
- `backend/services/waterPaymentsService.js` (lines 538-551) - Surgical update trigger
- `backend/services/waterDataService.js` - updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()
- `backend/services/penaltyRecalculationService.js` - Penalty calculation

**Cleanup Required:**
- Investigate if penalty recalculation is integrated
- Test partial payment scenarios
- Fix integration if missing
- Ensure penalties update correctly after payments

**Trigger for Cleanup:** Investigate immediately (affects financial accuracy)

**Estimated Cleanup Effort:** 2-3 hours (1 hour investigation + 1-2 hours fix if needed)

**Business Impact:** High - Financial accuracy, partial payment scenarios affected

**Documentation:** `docs/issues 2/open/TD_018_Water_Bills_Surgical_Penalty_Calculation_2025-10-18.md`

**Related Work:**
- WB2: Penalty Calc Optimization (Complete - October 17, 2025)
- Surgical Update Implementation (Complete - October 14, 2025)
- WB_DATA_FIX: Payment Modal (Complete - October 18, 2025)

### **TD-017: Migrate checkExchangeRatesHealth to 2nd Gen Cloud Function**
**Category:** Platform Migration  
**Priority:** Low  
**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Context:** Production Deployment v0.0.11

**Description:**
The `checkExchangeRatesHealth` function is still deployed as a 1st Gen Cloud Function (v1) while all other functions have been migrated to 2nd Gen. Firebase deployment attempted automatic migration but blocked with error: "Upgrading from 1st Gen to 2nd Gen is not yet supported."

**Current Impact:**
- **No production impact** - Function still works as 1st Gen
- Used only by manual trigger HTML page (`trigger-manual-update.html`)
- Not user-facing functionality
- Main API and scheduled functions already on 2nd Gen

**Code Locations:**
- `functions/index.js` - Lines 155-178 (checkExchangeRatesHealth definition)
- `functions/trigger-manual-update.html` - References old function URL

**Cleanup Required:**
- Update function definition to use 2nd Gen `onRequest` pattern
- Test health check endpoint functionality
- Update any URL references if needed
- Deploy updated function to production
- Delete old 1st Gen version from Firebase Console

**Trigger for Cleanup:** 
- Next Firebase Functions maintenance window
- Before Google announces 1st Gen deprecation
- Can be bundled with other functions upgrades

**Estimated Cleanup Effort:** 0.5-1 hour (simple migration)

**Business Impact:** Minimal - maintenance only, no user-facing changes

**Notes:**
- Discovered during v0.0.11 deployment (testing blockers fixes)
- All other functions successfully running on 2nd Gen
- Google will eventually deprecate 1st Gen functions

### **TD-003: PWA Backend Routes Misalignment**
**Category:** Architecture  
**Priority:** High  
**Created:** Identified in Manager Handover 5  
**Context:** PWA Infrastructure Migration

**Description:**
Mobile PWA currently uses outdated backend routing and database structures that don't align with the new desktop backend architecture and domain-specific routing patterns.

**Code Locations:**
- `frontend/mobile-app/src/api/` - Outdated API service patterns
- PWA authentication and data fetching services
- Mobile component backend integrations

**Cleanup Required:**
- Align PWA with new backend routing patterns
- Update mobile API services to use domain-specific endpoints
- Migrate PWA database structure integration
- Test all mobile functionality with new backend

**Trigger for Cleanup:** Split Transactions Phase 2+ completion (foundational work)

**Estimated Cleanup Effort:** 5-8 Implementation Agent sessions

**Business Impact:** High - PWA functionality degraded without alignment

### **TD-004: duesDistribution Fallback Code**
**Category:** Legacy Data Support  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Created:** 2025-01-19  
**Context:** Phase 2 HOA Allocations Remodel

**Description:**
During the Phase 2 HOA Dues remodel to use the new `allocations` array pattern, the Implementation Agent correctly maintained fallback support for the legacy `duesDistribution` array structure. This was necessary for testing with existing data and ensuring zero breakage during development.

**Code Locations:**
- `backend/controllers/hoaDues.js` - duesDistribution fallback logic
- `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/hoa/` - Legacy display components
- Transaction processing logic that handles both patterns

**Cleanup Required:**
- Remove all `duesDistribution` fallback code and breadcrumbs
- Eliminate dual-pattern handling logic
- Clean up any legacy display components
- Update documentation to reflect allocations-only pattern

**Trigger for Cleanup:** **DATA REIMPORT** - When production data is reimported with new allocations pattern

**Estimated Cleanup Effort:** 1-2 Implementation Agent sessions

**Business Impact:** None (cleanup only improves code maintainability)

### **TD-016: Mobile App Complete Refactor Required**
**Category:** Platform Architecture  
**Priority:** High (when mobile work resumes)  
**Created:** Identified in APM v0.3 Summary  
**Context:** Mobile/Desktop Alignment

**Description:**
Mobile app requires complete refactor to match new data structures, endpoints, and authorization patterns. Currently increasingly out of sync with desktop platform.

**Code Locations:**
- Entire mobile app codebase
- Mobile API integration layer
- Authentication and data fetching services

**Cleanup Required:**
- Complete mobile app architecture refactor
- Align with current backend API patterns
- Update authentication and authorization flows
- Migrate to current data structures

**Trigger for Cleanup:** When mobile development resumes

**Estimated Cleanup Effort:** 12-15 Implementation Agent sessions

**Business Impact:** High - Mobile platform becoming unusable due to drift
