Hey Michael — you’re right: Google Drive for Desktop doesn’t expose a clean “ignore patterns” UI on macOS anymore, so the practical way to keep node_modules local (per-machine) is to move them out of the Drive folder and symlink them back. Vite/Node work fine with symlinked node_modules.

Below is a safe, repeatable setup for your structure (root, backend, frontend, frontend/ui) that you’ll run on each Mac.

⸻

Goal
	•	Physically store node_modules outside Google Drive (local-only).
	•	Leave lightweight symlinks inside My Drive/Sandyland/SAMS/... so your tools still work.
	•	Each Mac gets its own local copies.

⸻

One-time layout (per Mac)
	1.	Pick a local cache path (outside Drive) and make folders:

mkdir -p ~/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/{root,backend,frontend,frontend-ui}

	2.	Define your project path (adjust if yours differs):

PROJECT="$HOME/Google Drive/My Drive/Sandyland/SAMS"

	3.	For each node_modules, move → symlink
(If any node_modules doesn’t exist yet, skip the mv for that one and just create the symlink, then run npm ci later.)

# ROOT
if [ -d "$PROJECT/node_modules" ]; then
  mv "$PROJECT/node_modules" "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/root/"
fi
ln -s "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/root/node_modules" "$PROJECT/node_modules"

# BACKEND
if [ -d "$PROJECT/backend/node_modules" ]; then
  mv "$PROJECT/backend/node_modules" "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/backend/"
fi
ln -s "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/backend/node_modules" "$PROJECT/backend/node_modules"

# FRONTEND
if [ -d "$PROJECT/frontend/node_modules" ]; then
  mv "$PROJECT/frontend/node_modules" "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/frontend/"
fi
ln -s "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/frontend/node_modules" "$PROJECT/frontend/node_modules"

# FRONTEND/UI
if [ -d "$PROJECT/frontend/ui/node_modules" ]; then
  mv "$PROJECT/frontend/ui/node_modules" "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/frontend-ui/"
fi
ln -s "$HOME/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/frontend-ui/node_modules" "$PROJECT/frontend/ui/node_modules"

	4.	If any were empty / new, populate them locally now:

cd "$PROJECT" && npm ci || true
cd "$PROJECT/backend" && npm ci || true
cd "$PROJECT/frontend" && npm ci || true
cd "$PROJECT/frontend/ui" && npm ci || true

Verify it worked

# You should see arrows (symlinks) pointing to your local cache paths:
ls -l "$PROJECT" "$PROJECT/backend" "$PROJECT/frontend" "$PROJECT/frontend/ui" | grep node_modules

# These should be large (actual data) OUTSIDE Drive:
du -sh ~/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/*/node_modules

# These should be tiny INSIDE Drive (they’re just links, not real folders):
du -sh "$PROJECT/node_modules" \
       "$PROJECT/backend/node_modules" \
       "$PROJECT/frontend/node_modules" \
       "$PROJECT/frontend/ui/node_modules"

Drive will only sync the tiny symlink files (a few bytes), not the contents they point to. Your builds keep humming because Node resolves through the symlink transparently.

⸻

Repeat on your other Mac

Do the same steps so that Mac #2 has its own local caches at the same absolute paths (i.e., also under ~/Developer/LocalModules/SAMS/...). Using the same path on both machines avoids broken symlinks.

⸻

Notes & tips
	•	Reversible: To undo, delete the symlink(s), move the node_modules folders back into the project, done.
	•	Git: You already ignore node_modules in .gitignore; this change doesn’t affect Git behavior.
	•	Package managers: Works with npm, pnpm, yarn, bun. (pnpm’s global store outside Drive is nice, but it still creates node_modules entries inside your project; the symlink approach guarantees Drive won’t ingest them.)
	•	Mac username differences: If the short username differs between Macs, keep the same cache path segment (e.g., always ~/Developer/LocalModules/...), and the symlinks will be valid on each machine independently.
