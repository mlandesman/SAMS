# Compact as APM Implementation Agent

You are reaching your context window limit so you will need to  prepare a handover document for the next Implementation Agent to complete your task. You will:

1. **Handover Document** Write everything we did so far to a properly formatted handover document using the instructions found in `/Users/michael/Projects/SAMS/.cursor/commands/apm-6-handover-implementation.md`. Ensure to clearly document the approach we're taking, the steps we've done so far, and the current failure we're working on. 
2. **Knowledge Transfer** If you are working on the problem, identify the problem, what you have tried so far that did not work and what you propose as the next steps to try to resolve it.
3. **Todo Update**: Update your current todo list and include that in the handover document at the top of the document as mandatory reading.  Make sure it is the COMPLETE todo list and not a subset for the current problem.
4. **Full Task Assignment** Include the file name of the original Task Assigned you are working on or the text if there was not file name provided.  Make sure the the Task is included in it's entirety even if some phases/tasks are completed.
5. **Prior Todo Completions** Keep in your handover document all of the Todos that have been completed before you so the manager can see the complete picture. Do not eliminate any phases or todos that were completed within the scope of the original Task Assignement.

## Final Steps
1. Acknowledge that you have properly written the handover document.
2. Create a prompt that can be copied and pasted into a new session that starts with '/newIA ' and then adds the path to your handover document.
