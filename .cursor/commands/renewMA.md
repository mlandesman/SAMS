# Compact as APM Manager Agent

You are reaching your context window limit so you will need to  prepare a handover document for the next Manager Agent to complete your work. You will:

1. **Todo Update**: Update your current todo list and include that in the handover document at the top of the document as mandatory reading.  Make sure it is the COMPLETE todo list and not a subset for the current problem.
2. **Prior Todo Completions** Keep in your handover document all of the Todos that have been completed before you took over so the next manager can see the complete picture. Do not eliminate any phases or todos that were completed within the scope of the original Task Assignement.
3. **Knowledge Transfer** If you are working on the problem, identify the problem, what you have tried so far that did not work and what you propose as the next steps to try to resolve it.
5. **Handover Document** Write everything we did so far to a properly formatted handover document using the instructions found in `/Users/michael/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-michael@landesman.com/My Drive/Sandyland/SAMS-Docs/apm/prompts/Manager_Agent/Manager_Agent_Handover_Guide.md`. Start with the current Todo List and the Next Steps. Ensure to note the approach we're taking, the steps we've done so far, and the current tasks we're working on.  Include the Task File names that are current assigned and being worked. 


## Final Steps
1. Acknowledge that you have properly written the handover document.
2. Create a prompt that can be copied and pasted into a new session that starts with '/newMA ' and then adds the path to your handover document.
