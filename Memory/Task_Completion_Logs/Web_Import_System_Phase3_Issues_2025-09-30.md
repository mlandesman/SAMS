## ⚠️ Critical Issue Found: Year-End Balance Data Structure Mismatch

### Problem Description

The `importYearEndBalances` function in `/backend/services/importService.js` creates an incorrect data structure that doesn't match the expected format used by the application.

### Current (Incorrect) Structure Created by Import:
```javascript
{
  accounts: {
    0: {
      active: true,
      balance: 13953067,
      currency: "USD",
      id: "bank-001",
      lastRebuildSnapshot: "2024-12-31",
      name: "MTC Bank",
      type: "bank",
      updated: "September 29, 2025 at 5:34:15 PM UTC-5"
    },
    1: {
      active: true,
      balance: 10105394,
      currency: "USD",
      id: "cash-001",
      lastRebuildSnapshot: "2024-12-31",
      name: "Cash Account",
      type: "cash",
      updated: "September 29, 2025 at 5:34:08 PM UTC-5"
    }
  },
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Expected (Correct) Structure:
```javascript
{
  accounts: [  // Should be an ARRAY, not an object
    {
      balance: 5140200,
      id: "bank-001",
      name: "Scotiabank"
    },
    {
      balance: 0,
      id: "cash-001", 
      name: "Petty Cash"
    }
  ],
  created: "August 6, 2025 at 2:53:15 PM UTC-5",
  createdBy: "import-script",
  date: "June 29, 2025 at 7:00:00 PM UTC-5",
  year: 2025
}
```

### Key Issues:

1. **Accounts as Object vs Array**: The import creates accounts as an object with numeric keys (0, 1, 2...) instead of a proper array
2. **Extra Fields**: The import adds unnecessary fields like:
   - `active`
   - `currency` 
   - `lastRebuildSnapshot`
   - `type`
   - `updated`
3. **Missing/Wrong Top-Level Fields**: 
   - Uses `importDate` instead of `created`
   - Uses `createdBy: "michael@landesman.com"` instead of `"import-script"`
   - Includes unnecessary `metadata` and `originalData` fields
   - Incorrect totals structure

### Impact:

This structure mismatch will prevent the application from properly reading year-end balances, which could affect:
- Balance reports
- Financial calculations
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Any features that depend on historical balance data

## Recommendations for Manager Agent

1. **Immediate Fix Required**: The `importYearEndBalances` function needs to be rewritten to match the expected data structure exactly
2. **Data Cleanup**: The incorrectly imported data for MTC should be deleted and re-imported with the correct structure
3. **Consider Adding**: 
   - Data structure validation before writing to Firestore
   - Unit tests to verify correct data structure
   - Documentation of expected data formats

## Test Results Summary

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Purge - Dry Run | ✅ Success | Shows accurate counts |
| Purge - Actual Delete | ✅ Success | Year-end balances deleted correctly |
| Import - Endpoints | ✅ Success | All endpoints responding |
| Import - File Loading | ✅ Success | Reads from data path |
| Import - Data Structure | ❌ Failed | Creates wrong structure |
| Progress Tracking | ✅ Success | Real-time updates work |
| Error Handling | ✅ Success | Proper user feedback |

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/controllers/importController.js` - Fixed async/await and audit log calls
2. `/backend/services/importService.js` - Fixed import order validation
3. `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/Settings/ImportManagement.jsx` - Added dry run mode and fixed polling

## Next Steps

1. Manager Agent should prioritize fixing the year-end balance import structure
2. Consider implementing Phase 4 (Production Readiness) features:
   - Automatic backups before purge
   - Import validation preview
   - Operation history logs
   - Better error recovery

## Handover Notes

- All endpoints are functional
- UI is production-ready
- Main blocker is the data structure mismatch in year-end balance imports
- Other import functions (categories, vendors, etc.) should be tested for similar issues
