# Split Transactions Project Archive - September 2025

## Project Completion Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

This archive contains all documentation, task assignments, handover files, and implementation artifacts from the completed Split Transactions Enhancement project.

## Project Overview

**Duration:** Multiple phases from initial analysis through full implementation  
**Completion Date:** September 2025  
**Final Status:** Production-ready with Quicken-style split transaction interface

## Key Achievements

- ✅ **ID-First Architecture:** Frontend sends IDs, backend resolves ID→name for robust data integrity
- ✅ **SplitEntryModal:** Real ID-based allocation entry with running balance validation  
- ✅ **Transaction Display:** Split transactions show "-Split-" category with expandable breakdown
- ✅ **HOA Allocations Foundation:** Generalized allocations pattern successfully established
- ✅ **Backend Integration:** createTransaction handles allocations array with validation
- ✅ **Full Integration:** Complete system integration with existing transaction architecture

## Architecture Principles Established

1. **ID-First Data Flow:** All frontend components store and send IDs instead of names
2. **Backend Name Resolution:** Server resolves ID→name for display (prevents data corruption)
3. **Allocations Array Pattern:** Standardized structure for split transaction storage
4. **Running Balance Validation:** Real-time validation ensures allocation totals match transaction amounts

## Follow-up Work Identified

**Next Priority:** Edit Transactions Enhancement
- Edit function needs updates to handle ID-first structures
- Split transactions need proper editing via SplitEntryModal
- Form state should maintain ID-based architecture

**Future Enhancements:** Phase 4 Split Transactions Analytics
- Enhanced reporting with split transaction filtering
- Category-based analysis and insights
- Bulk operations on split transactions

## Production Status

The split transactions feature is **LIVE and WORKING** in the production SAMS system at sams.sandyland.com.mx. Users can:

- Create split transactions via the Quicken-style interface
- View split transaction breakdowns in transaction lists  
- All data is stored using the robust ID-first architecture
- Integration with existing HOA dues and transaction systems is complete
