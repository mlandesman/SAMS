# Manager Agent Handover File 4 - SAMS Communications Enhancement & Split Transactions

## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:**
- Complete Water Bills UI tasks first before releasing API migration agent from hold
- Create comprehensive Split Transactions Enhancement plan for major financial system upgrade
- Prioritize Infrastructure cleanup (API domain migration) for Implementation Agent consistency
- Focus on go-live readiness with professional quality standards
- Use MCP-enhanced development capabilities for professional results

**Decisions:**
- Split Transactions identified as major architectural enhancement (12-18 sessions total effort)
- Water Bills UI completion prioritized over API migration (both agents assigned but coordinated)
- Infrastructure foundation (API domain migration) critical before expanding to new features
- MCP integration provides enhanced development workflow for professional quality
- Compartmentalized task assignments for rotating Implementation Agent efficiency

**Current Development Status:**
- Water Bills UI: Phase 4 ‚úÖ Complete (Bills screen Washes column), Phase 5 üîÑ In Progress (History screen wash indicators)
- Split Transactions: Master plan ‚úÖ Complete with 6 detailed phase task files
- API Domain Migration: Agent assigned but on hold pending Water Bills completion
- Communications Enhancement: Phase 2A ‚úÖ Complete, Phase 2B ready for assignment

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- ‚úÖ Water Bills Backend washes array processing ‚Üí COMPLETED and working
- ‚úÖ Water Bills Desktop UI [Washes] button ‚Üí COMPLETED with WashModal component  
- ‚úÖ Water Bills Bills screen Washes column ‚Üí COMPLETED today by Implementation Agent
- üîÑ Water Bills History screen wash indicators ‚Üí IN PROGRESS (Phase 5)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è API domain migration ‚Üí ON HOLD pending Water Bills UI completion
- ‚úÖ Split Transactions master plan ‚Üí COMPLETED with comprehensive 6-phase task files
- üìã Split Transactions Phase 1 Discovery ‚Üí READY for Implementation Agent assignment

**Coordination Insights:**
- Water Bills Implementation Agent making excellent progress (Phases 4-5 nearly complete)
- API migration agent coordinated to wait for Water Bills completion (prevents conflict)
- Split Transactions requires deep architectural analysis before implementation
- MCP integration enables professional-quality development with live Firebase data
- User prefers sequential task completion over parallel development to reduce agent confusion

## Next Actions
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Post Water Bills UI Completion):**
1. **HIGH PRIORITY: Release API Domain Migration Agent**
   - Task File: "Task Assignment: Complete API Domain Migration + baseURL Standardization"
   - Scope: Eliminate ALL `/api/` confusion, standardize single baseURL pattern
   - Impact: Critical for Implementation Agent consistency and error prevention

2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Split Transactions Phase 1**
   - Task File: "Phase_1_Split_Transactions_Discovery.md"
   - Scope: Deep discovery and analysis of current transaction architecture
   - Effort: 2-3 Implementation Agent sessions

**MEDIUM PRIORITY READY ASSIGNMENTS:**
3. **Communications Phase 2B Enhancement**
   - Task File: "HANDOVER_COMMUNICATIONS_PHASE_2A_COMPLETION.md"
   - Scope: Water Bills payment request templates, HOA notification templates
   - Status: Phase 2A complete, Phase 2B ready with MCP enhancement

4. **Water Bills Email Templates Completion**
   - Task File: "TASK_ASSIGNMENT_WATER_BILLS_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md"
   - Scope: Complete templates with live Firebase MCP data integration
   - Enhancement: MCP-enabled professional development workflow

5. **PWA Maintenance Role Integration**
   - Task File: "Task Assignment: Integrate new Maintenance user role into PWA"
   - Scope: PWA role system updates for new user type

6. **Desktop UI Wash Array Support**
   - Task File: "Task_Assignment_Desktop_UI_Wash_Array_Support.md"  
   - Scope: Desktop water bills UI wash array format support

**Blocked Items:**
- None - all critical dependencies resolved for immediate assignment

**Phase Transition:**
Current phase focuses on completing initiated features (Water Bills UI) and infrastructure cleanup (API migration) before advancing to major architectural changes (Split Transactions). Foundation work critical for Implementation Agent success.

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:**
- Split Transactions: 6 comprehensive phase files in `/Memory/Task_Assignments/`
- Water Bills: Backend services completed, Desktop UI nearly complete
- API Configuration: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/config/index.js` needs single baseURL standardization
- MCP Integration: Firebase MCP (36 tools) and Gmail MCP configured for enhanced development
- Task Assignments: All major enhancements documented with detailed specifications

**Coordination Strategies:**
- Sequential task completion preferred over parallel to reduce Implementation Agent confusion
- Use MCP-enhanced workflows for professional quality results
- Focus on infrastructure foundation before expanding to new features
- Compartmentalized assignments with specific technical requirements
- Complete one domain migration before moving to next for systematic approach

**User Preferences:**
- Direct communication style, minimal explanations unless requested
- Prefers systematic, complete implementation over partial features
- Values Implementation Agent consistency and error reduction as top priority
- Appreciates comprehensive planning before major architectural changes
- Focused on go-live readiness with professional quality standards
- Wants clean code with no legacy support (test data environment)

## Critical Implementation Context
**Water Bills UI Status:**
- ‚úÖ Backend processes `washes: [{type: 'car'|'boat', date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', cost: 100|200}]` format
- ‚úÖ Desktop UI has [Washes] button with color-coded states  
- ‚úÖ Bills screen Washes column implemented today (Phase 4 complete)
- üîÑ History screen wash indicators in progress (Phase 5, final phase)
- ‚úÖ PWA and Desktop use identical data structures

**Split Transactions Architecture Planning:**
- **Business Need:** Handle IVA (tax), bank commissions, combined deposits for multiple payment types
- **Technical Scope:** 1:1 transaction-category ‚Üí split transactions with "-Split-" display
- **System Impact:** Database schema, API endpoints, UI components, search/filtering, reporting
- **Phases Created:** 6 detailed task files covering discovery through deployment
- **Effort Estimate:** 12-18 Implementation Agent sessions total
- **Approach:** Quicken-style interface with split modal functionality

**API Domain Migration Critical Context:**
- **Root Problem:** Dual baseURL patterns cause `/api/api/` double-prefix errors
- **Current State:** Mixed patterns confuse Implementation Agents  
- **Solution:** Complete domain separation with single baseURL configuration
- **Priority:** Critical infrastructure work before feature expansion
- **Agent Status:** Assigned but on hold until Water Bills UI completion

**MCP Integration Status:**
- **Firebase MCP:** ‚úÖ Connected with 36 tools for live data integration
- **Gmail MCP:** ‚úÖ Configured for email testing and delivery verification
