# Task Assignment: Phase 3 - Split Transactions Backend API Development

## Agent Type: Implementation Agent
## Priority: High
## Dependencies: Phase 2 Database Design & Migration complete

## Task Overview
Develop and modify backend API endpoints to support split transaction creation, modification, retrieval, and validation while maintaining compatibility with existing single-category transaction workflows.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Transaction Creation API Enhancement**
   - Modify createTransaction endpoint to handle split transaction data
   - Implement validation for split amount totals vs transaction amount
   - Add atomic transaction creation for parent + split components
   - Maintain backward compatibility for single-category transactions

2. **Transaction Retrieval API Updates**
   - Update getTransactions to return split component data
   - Modify transaction filtering to work with split categories
   - Enhance search functionality for split transaction components
   - Optimize queries for performance with split data model

3. **Transaction Modification APIs**
   - Create updateSplitTransaction endpoint for split modifications
   - Implement convertToSplit and convertToSingle operations
   - Add split component CRUD operations (add/remove/modify splits)
   - Ensure audit trail logging for all split modifications

4. **Validation and Business Logic**
   - Implement split amount validation (must sum to transaction total)
   - Add category validation for split components
   - Create business rules for split transaction constraints
   - Implement error handling for invalid split configurations

## Deliverables Required
1. **Updated Transaction Controllers** - Enhanced API endpoints
2. **Split Transaction Service Layer** - Business logic implementation
3. **Validation Middleware** - Split transaction validation rules
4. **API Documentation** - Updated endpoint specifications
5. **Integration Tests** - Comprehensive API testing

## API Endpoints to Modify/Create
- `POST /transactions` - Enhanced for split support
- `PUT /transactions/:id` - Support split modifications
- `GET /transactions` - Return split data in responses
- `GET /transactions/:id` - Include split component details
- `POST /transactions/:id/convert-to-split` - Convert single to split
- `POST /transactions/:id/convert-to-single` - Convert split to single
- `PUT /transactions/:id/splits` - Bulk split component updates

## Backend Services to Enhance
- Transaction creation service
- Transaction validation service
- Category assignment service
- Audit logging service
- Transaction search/filter service
- Reporting aggregation service

## Validation Rules to Implement
- Split amounts must sum exactly to transaction total
- Each split component must have valid category
- Minimum one split component required for split transactions
- Maximum reasonable number of split components (e.g., 50)
- Split component amounts must be positive (or negative for credits)
- Category budgets must account for split allocations

## Error Handling Requirements
- Clear error messages for split validation failures
- Rollback capability for failed split transaction creation
- Graceful handling of concurrent split modifications
- Detailed logging for debugging split transaction issues
- User-friendly error responses for UI consumption

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize database queries for split transaction retrieval
- Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed splits
- Minimize API calls required for split transaction operations
- Ensure response times comparable to single-category transactions
- Plan for pagination with split transaction search results

## Integration Points
- HOA Dues payment creation with split support
- Water Bills payment processing with splits
- General transaction entry with split capabilities
- Reporting services aggregation across split components
- Category budget tracking with split allocations

## Success Criteria
- All transaction creation workflows support split transactions
- Split validation prevents invalid configurations
- API performance maintains current benchmarks
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing clients
- Comprehensive error handling and logging implemented
- Integration tests achieve 95%+ coverage

## Estimated Effort
3-4 Implementation Agent sessions

## Next Phase
Upon completion, Phase 4: Frontend Components Development

## Coordination Notes
- API changes require Manager Agent review before frontend integration
- Coordinate with ongoing API domain migration work
- Ensure compatibility with current authentication/authorization
- Plan deployment strategy to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Consider feature flags for gradual split transaction rollout
