# Task Assignment: Phase 1 - Split Transactions Discovery & Analysis

## Agent Type: Implementation Agent
## Priority: High
## Dependencies: None

## Task Overview
Conduct comprehensive discovery and analysis of the current SAMS transaction system to understand the scope and requirements for implementing split transaction functionality.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Transaction Data Model Analysis**
   - Map current transaction table structure and relationships
   - Identify all transaction entry points across the system
   - Document current category assignment mechanisms
   - Analyze existing transaction validation logic

2. **UI/UX Current State Assessment**
   - Catalog all transaction entry forms (HOA, Water Bills, general)
   - Document current transaction display components
   - Map transaction editing workflows
   - Identify filter/search interfaces that use categories

3. **Backend API Endpoint Inventory**
   - List all transaction-related endpoints
   - Document current createTransaction logic
   - Map transaction retrieval and filtering methods
   - Identify reporting/analytics that depend on categories

4. **Integration Points Mapping**
   - Document HOA Dues transaction creation flow
   - Document Water Bills payment transaction flow
   - Identify any automated transaction creation processes
   - Map transaction-to-category dependency chains

## Deliverables Required
1. **Current_Transaction_Architecture.md** - Complete technical documentation
2. **Transaction_Entry_Points_Analysis.md** - All UI forms and workflows
3. **API_Endpoints_Impact_Assessment.md** - Backend changes required
4. **Split_Transaction_Requirements_Specification.md** - Detailed functional requirements

## Analysis Focus Areas
- How transactions currently link to categories
- Where category validation occurs
- Current transaction amount handling and validation
- Existing audit trail mechanisms
- Search/filter logic dependencies on single-category model
- Performance considerations for current queries

## Discovery Questions to Answer
- What is the exact database schema for transactions?
- Are there any existing multi-category scenarios being handled?
- How do HOA and Water Bill payments currently create transactions?
- What validation rules exist for transaction amounts vs category budgets?
- Are there any reporting features that aggregate by category?
- How are transaction modifications currently audited?

## Research Methods
- Code analysis using search tools (Grep, Glob, Read)
- Database schema examination
- Workflow tracing from entry points
- API endpoint documentation review
- UI component relationship mapping

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of current transaction architecture
- Clear identification of all required changes for split functionality
- Detailed impact assessment for database, backend, and frontend
- Comprehensive requirements specification for split transactions
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies identified

## Estimated Effort
2-3 Implementation Agent sessions

## Next Phase
Upon completion, findings will inform Phase 2: Database Design & Migration Strategy

## Coordination Notes
- Findings must be reviewed by Manager Agent before proceeding to Phase 2
- Focus on discovery only - no code changes or implementations
- Document assumptions and unknowns for follow-up investigation
- Prioritize understanding over speed - this analysis drives the entire project
