# Task Assignment: Phase 2 - Split Transactions Database Design & Migration Strategy

## Agent Type: Implementation Agent
## Priority: High  
## Dependencies: Phase 1 Discovery & Analysis complete

## Task Overview
Design the database schema changes and migration strategy required to support split transactions while preserving existing single-category transaction functionality.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Design split transaction storage model
   - Plan relationship between parent transaction and split components
   - Ensure data integrity constraints for split amounts
   - Preserve existing transaction audit trail capabilities

2. **Migration Strategy Development**
   - Create migration scripts for existing transaction data
   - Plan backward compatibility approach
   - Design rollback procedures for schema changes
   - Identify data validation requirements post-migration

3. **Performance Impact Assessment**
   - Analyze query performance implications of new schema
   - Design indexing strategy for split transaction queries
   - Plan optimization for category-based filtering with splits
   - Assess storage overhead of split transaction model

4. **Data Integrity Framework**
   - Design validation rules for split amount totals
   - Plan constraint enforcement at database level
   - Create audit trail extensions for split modifications
   - Design referential integrity for split components

## Deliverables Required
1. **Split_Transaction_Schema_Design.sql** - Complete DDL for new structure
2. **Migration_Strategy_Document.md** - Step-by-step migration plan
3. **Data_Migration_Scripts.sql** - Scripts to convert existing data
4. **Performance_Impact_Analysis.md** - Query performance assessment
5. **Data_Integrity_Rules.md** - Validation and constraint specifications

## Design Considerations
- Maintain transaction amount as authoritative source
- Split components must sum exactly to parent transaction amount
- Preserve existing transaction table structure where possible
- Support unlimited split components per transaction
- Maintain category assignment for single-category transactions
- Enable efficient querying by individual categories within splits

## Technical Requirements
- Support for both single-category and split transactions
- Atomic operations for split transaction creation/modification
- Efficient category-based reporting across split components
- Audit trail for all split component changes
- Foreign key relationships to existing category system
- Performance parity with current single-category queries

## Migration Strategy Focus
- Zero-downtime deployment approach
- Existing data preservation and validation
- Rollback capability if issues arise
- Gradual rollout strategy for split functionality
- Testing approach for migrated data integrity

## Database Design Questions to Resolve
- Should splits be stored in separate table or JSON field?
- How to maintain referential integrity with category table?
- What indexing strategy optimizes both single and split queries?
- How to handle transaction modification audit trails for splits?
- What constraints prevent invalid split configurations?

## Success Criteria
- Schema supports both single and split transactions seamlessly
- Migration preserves all existing transaction data
- Performance meets or exceeds current transaction query speeds
- Data integrity enforced at database level
- Clear rollback path exists for schema changes
- Audit trail functionality maintained and extended

## Estimated Effort
1-2 Implementation Agent sessions

## Next Phase
Upon completion, Phase 3: Backend API Development

## Coordination Notes
- Schema design requires Manager Agent approval before implementation
- Migration strategy must be reviewed for production safety
- Performance benchmarks should be established before changes
- Coordinate with ongoing Water Bills and API migration work
- Consider impact on current backup and recovery procedures
