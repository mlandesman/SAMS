# Browser Cache Resolution Guide for Water Bills Display Issue

## Issue Summary
The frontend displays "Reading Period: August 2025" instead of the date range format "08/28/25 - 09/27/25" due to browser caching of old JavaScript bundles.

## Resolution Steps

### Step 1: Clear Site Data (Recommended)
Since you already have Chrome DevTools open:
1. In the Application tab, click the **"Clear site data"** button
2. This will clear:
   - Service workers
   - Cache storage
   - Local storage
   - Session storage
   - Cookies

### Step 2: Verify Fresh Load
1. After clearing, refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. Open the Network tab in DevTools
3. Look for the main JavaScript bundle files
4. Verify they show "200" status (not "304 Not Modified" or "(from cache)")

### Step 3: Check Console for Debug Output
1. Open Console tab in DevTools
2. Look for any errors or the debug messages if using the debug version
3. Check for "New version available!" messages

### Step 4: Verify API Response
1. In Network tab, filter by "Fetch/XHR"
2. Find the water data API call (look for "aggregated" or "water")
3. Check the Response to see if `readingPeriod.display` is present
4. Should see something like:
   ```json
   "readingPeriod": {
     "display": "08/28/25 - 09/27/25",
     "start": {...},
     "end": {...}
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Alternative Cache Clearing Methods
If the issue persists:

1. **Hard Refresh**: 
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+R
   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+R

2. **Disable Cache in DevTools**:
   - Network tab → Check "Disable cache"
   - Keep DevTools open while testing

3. **Incognito/Private Window**:
   - Open site in incognito mode
   - This bypasses all caches

### Step 6: Service Worker Specific
If service worker is still causing issues:
1. Application tab → Service Workers
2. Click "Unregister" for any workers
3. Refresh the page

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Site data cleared via DevTools
- [ ] Page refreshed after clearing
- [ ] Network tab shows fresh JS files (not cached)
- [ ] API response contains `readingPeriod.display`
- [ ] UI shows date range format (e.g., "08/28/25 - 09/27/25")
- [ ] No "New version available!" dialog appears

## What Success Looks Like
Instead of: "Reading Period: August 2025"
You should see: "Reading Period: 08/28/25 - 09/27/25"

## Technical Notes
- The code implementation is correct in both backend and frontend
- Backend sends pre-formatted dates with America/Cancun timezone
- Frontend displays the pre-formatted string without date manipulation
- This is purely a browser cache issue, not a code issue
