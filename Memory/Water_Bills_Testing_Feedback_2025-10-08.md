## Testing Results

### ‚úÖ WORKING CORRECTLY
1. **Reading Period Date Range Display**
   - After manual date correction in Firebase, displays correctly
   - Format: "MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY" working as expected
   - Successfully shows actual time between meter readings

2. **Auto-Advance on Bills Tab**
   - ‚úÖ Correctly jumps to most recent generated bill
   - Working as implemented

3. **History Grid Formatting**
   - Presumed working (no issues reported)
   - All 12 months displaying
   - HOA Dues style matching

4. **Read-Only Due Dates**
   - Presumed working (no issues reported)
   - Shows text instead of picker when bill generated

## üêõ ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue 1: Auto-Advance on Readings Tab NOT WORKING
**Status:** Bug - Feature not functioning  
**Expected:** Should advance to next unsaved month  
**Actual:** Does not auto-advance  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - UX impact but not blocking  
**Location:** `WaterBillsViewV3.jsx` - Readings tab logic

### Issue 2: Fiscal Year Wrap-Around for Reading Period
**Status:** Enhancement needed  
**Current:** Month 0 (July) has no prior month reading period  
**Expected:** Month 0 should look at Month 11 (June) of prior fiscal year  
**Impact:** First month of fiscal year shows incomplete reading period  
**Priority:** LOW - Edge case, enhancement  
**Location:** `WaterReadingEntry.jsx` - Reading period calculation

## Technical Analysis

### Auto-Advance Readings Bug
The implementation in `WaterBillsViewV3.jsx` may have:
1. Logic error in detecting saved vs unsaved months
2. useEffect dependency issue
3. Timing issue with data loading
4. Different data structure than expected

**Needs Investigation:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify the logic for detecting "saved" readings
- Compare with working Bills tab logic

### Fiscal Year Wrap Enhancement
**Current Logic:**
```javascript
const priorMonth = selectedMonth === 0 ? 11 : selectedMonth - 1;
const priorMonthData = yearData.months[priorMonth];
```

**Issue:** When `selectedMonth` is 0, it looks at month 11 of SAME year, not prior year

**Solution Approach:**
- Need to fetch prior year data when on month 0
- Calculate: If month 0 of 2026, look at month 11 of 2025
- May require additional API call for prior year

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Debug Auto-Advance Readings**
   - Priority fix since it's a regression
   - Should work as documented
   - Investigate why Bills works but Readings doesn't

### Future Enhancement
2. **Fiscal Year Wrap-Around**
   - Add to backlog as enhancement
   - Implement when touching reading period logic
   - Consider caching prior year's last month

### Testing Notes
- Manual date correction workflow confirmed working
- Consider adding date management UI in future
- All other features appear to be working correctly

---

## Summary

**Overall Status:** MOSTLY WORKING
- Core features functional
- One bug (auto-advance readings)
- One enhancement opportunity (fiscal year wrap)
- Production deployment still viable with known issues

**Next Steps:**
1. Create bug fix task for auto-advance readings
2. Add fiscal year wrap to enhancement backlog
3. Consider these non-blocking for production
