# Task Assignment: Fix HOA Dues Credit Balance Cascading Delete

## Task Overview
**Agent:** Agent_HOA_Credit_Balance_Delete  
**Priority:** HIGH - Technical Debt / Data Integrity Issue  
**Category:** HOA Dues Credit Balance Management  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Issue Type:** Regression - Previously working functionality now broken

## Problem Analysis

HOA Dues Payment deletion does not properly reverse Credit Balance amounts, leaving the credit balance history in an inconsistent state. This was previously working functionality that has been broken during recent system changes.

### Critical Data Integrity Impact:
- **Credit Balance Corruption**: Deleting HOA payment leaves credit balance artificially high
- **Audit Trail Broken**: Credit balance usage history not properly reversed
- **Financial Inconsistency**: Unit credit balances do not reflect actual payment history
- **User Impact**: Incorrect credit balances affect future payment calculations

### Root Cause Analysis Required:
- **Credit History Array**: Units 'dues' collection contains credit balance usage history that should be reversed
- **Cascading Delete Logic**: HOA Dues payment deletion should trigger credit balance reversal
- **Data Structure**: Need to identify exact format of credit balance history tracking
- **Backend Integration**: Determine which controller handles the deletion cascade

## Technical Investigation Required

### 1. Identify Credit Balance Data Structure
**Location:** Units collection `dues` subdocument
- Find the array that traces credit balance history
- Document the structure of credit balance entries
- Identify how credit usage and additions are tracked
- Verify the relationship between payments and credit history entries

### 2. Analyze Current Deletion Flow
**Backend File:** Likely `backend/controllers/hoaDuesController.js`
- Trace the current HOA payment deletion logic
- Identify where cascade delete operations are handled
- Find existing credit balance update logic
- Document the current transaction deletion flow

### 3. Find Previous Working Implementation
**Git Investigation:** Search commit history for previous credit balance reversal code
- Look for deleted/modified credit balance reversal logic
- Identify when this functionality was removed or broken
- Document the previous approach for restoration reference

## Required Implementation

### Step 1: Document Current State
1. **Analyze Units Credit Structure**
   ```bash
   # Find a unit with credit history to analyze structure
   # Document the exact format of the dues.creditHistory array (or similar)
   ```

2. **Map Current Deletion Flow**
   ```javascript
   // backend/controllers/hoaDuesController.js - likely location
   // Find the DELETE endpoint for HOA payments
   // Document current cascade delete logic
   ```

### Step 2: Implement Credit Balance Reversal

1. **Add Credit History Reversal Logic**
   - When HOA payment is deleted, identify associated credit balance changes
   - Reverse any credit balance usage recorded for that payment
   - Remove any credit balance additions made by that payment
   - Update the credit balance history array to remove payment-related entries

2. **Ensure Data Consistency**
   - Verify unit's current credit balance matches history after deletion
   - Handle edge cases (partial credit usage, multiple payment scenarios)
   - Add validation to ensure credit balance never goes negative incorrectly

### Step 3: Add Comprehensive Testing

1. **Create Test Scenarios**
   - Payment with credit usage → delete payment → verify credit restored
   - Overpayment creating credit → delete payment → verify credit removed
   - Mixed payment (partial credit + new charges) → delete → verify proper reversal
   - Multiple payments affecting same credit pool → test selective deletion

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- HOA Dues payment deletion properly reverses credit balance changes
- Credit balance history array accurately reflects current state after deletion
- Unit credit balances are mathematically consistent with payment history
- No credit balance corruption after payment deletion operations

### ✅ Data Integrity Requirements
- Credit balance never becomes negative unless legitimately owed
- Credit history array entries properly linked to existing payments
- Audit trail maintains complete record of credit balance changes
- Database consistency maintained across all related collections

### ✅ Testing Requirements
- Manual testing of all credit balance scenarios
- Verification with actual AVII client data (if safe)
- Console output showing before/after credit balance states
- Unit tests for credit balance reversal logic (if testing framework exists)

## Files to Investigate/Modify

### Primary Files:
1. `backend/controllers/hoaDuesController.js` - Payment deletion endpoint
2. `backend/models/` - Unit/dues data model definitions  
3. `backend/services/` - Credit balance management services
4. Database collections: `units`, `transactions`, `dues` subdocuments

### Supporting Files:
1. Frontend deletion confirmation (ensure proper backend call)
2. Credit balance utilities/services
3. Transaction cascade delete logic

## Investigation Protocol

### Phase 1: Discovery (30 minutes)
1. **Find Credit History Structure**
   - Examine units collection in database
   - Identify credit balance tracking array format
   - Document relationship to payment records

2. **Locate Deletion Logic**
   - Find HOA payment DELETE endpoint
   - Trace current cascade delete implementation
   - Identify missing credit balance reversal step

### Phase 2: Implementation (1.5-2 hours)
1. **Add Credit Reversal Logic**
   - Implement credit balance history reversal
   - Add proper error handling and validation
   - Ensure atomic operations (all-or-nothing updates)

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Create test payment with credit usage
   - Delete payment and verify credit restoration
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Phase 3: Validation (30 minutes)
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test multiple credit scenarios
   - Verify database consistency
   - Confirm no regression in other functionality

## Critical Guidelines

- **DO NOT** modify credit balance logic without understanding current data structure
- **BACKUP** any units with complex credit history before testing
- **VERIFY** mathematical accuracy of all credit balance calculations
- **TEST** extensively with non-production data before any real client testing
- **DOCUMENT** exact steps for credit balance reversal for future maintenance

## Error Scenarios to Handle

1. **Payment Not Found** - Graceful error, no credit changes
2. **Credit History Corruption** - Validate and repair if possible
3. **Multiple Credit Entries** - Handle partial reversals correctly
4. **Concurrent Access** - Prevent race conditions in credit updates
5. **Database Failures** - Ensure atomic operations, rollback on failure

## Success Validation

**Before claiming completion:**
1. Create HOA payment that uses existing credit balance
2. Note the credit balance before and after payment creation
3. Delete the payment
4. Verify credit balance returns to pre-payment amount
5. Confirm credit history array is properly updated
6. Test with multiple scenarios including overpayments

**Report back with:**
- Screenshots showing credit balance before/after deletion
- Database queries showing credit history array changes
- Confirmation that all test scenarios work correctly
- Any edge cases discovered during implementation

## Handoff Requirements

- Detailed documentation of credit balance reversal logic implemented
- Test results for all scenarios
- Database migration notes (if any schema changes required)
- Instructions for testing credit balance integrity in production
