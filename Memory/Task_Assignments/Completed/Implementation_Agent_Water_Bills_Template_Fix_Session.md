# Task Log: Water Bills Template Variable Replacement Fix

## Summary
Fixed water bills template variable replacement by correcting sample data format from `__Variable__` to `Variable` and simplifying processing logic to match Firebase template expectations.

## Details
Root cause identified as template variable format mismatch between sample data (`__Variable__` format) and Firebase templates (`{{Variable}}` format). Following user feedback to "fix the sample data that we will throw away when done," corrected sample data format and simplified processing logic.

Key work performed:
- Updated waterBillSamples variables from `__Variable__` to `Variable` format to match Firebase expectations
- Simplified processWaterBillTemplate function to remove complex underscore-stripping logic
- Confirmed Firebase MCP integration and `/comm` proxy configuration working correctly
- Verified template loading, error handling, and retry functionality maintained

## Output
- Modified files: frontend/sams-ui/src/views/DigitalReceiptDemo.jsx
- Lines 75-199: Updated waterBillSamples variable format (ClientName, UnitNumber, etc.)
- Lines 213-242: Simplified processWaterBillTemplate function with clean {{Variable}} replacement
- Maintained Handlebars conditional support ({{#if}}, {{else}}, {{/if}})
- All existing functionality preserved: loading states, error handling, bilingual support

## Issues
None

## Important Findings
User preferences identified for future task execution:
- Prefers simple solutions over complex processing logic
- Values clean, maintainable code in permanent codebase
- Practical approach: fix temporary test data rather than build complex format handlers
- Development environment uses local Vite dev server with Firebase MCP integration
- Template processing follows standard Handlebars-style {{Variable}} replacement pattern

## Next Steps
User will handle Firebase template cleanup independently. Task completed successfully with water bill template variable replacement now functioning correctly.
