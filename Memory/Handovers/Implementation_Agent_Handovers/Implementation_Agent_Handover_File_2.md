## Active Memory Context

**User Preferences:**
- User explicitly prefers backend solutions over frontend overrides when fixing data consistency issues
- User wants comprehensive testing with different scenarios (full payments, partial payments, overpayments) across different months
- User prefers iterative testing approach - fix backend logic first, then integrate with frontend
- User wants to delete and regenerate bills to use any amounts needed for testing
- User expects proper logging and debugging output to verify fixes
- User wants surgical updates to real-time data after payments or bill generation

**Working Insights:**
- The Water Bills system uses a fiscal year starting in July (month 0) which maps to calendar year months
- Bill periods are formatted as "YYYY-MM" where YYYY is the fiscal year and MM is the fiscal month (00-11)
- The system has both raw bill data and aggregatedData for fast reads - both must be consistent
- Payment distribution logic must apply payments chronologically (oldest bills first)
- Backdated payments require penalty recalculation based on the payment date, not stored penalties
- The frontend table and payment modal must read from the same data sources to avoid mismatches

## Task Execution Context

**Working Environment:**
- Backend server runs on port 5001 (`backend/index.js`)
- Frontend runs on port 5173 (Vite dev server)
- Firebase project: sandyland-management-system
- Main payment logic in `backend/services/waterPaymentsService.js`
- Frontend components: `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/water/WaterBillsList.jsx` and `WaterPaymentModal.jsx`
- API routes in `backend/routes/waterRoutes.js`

**Issues Identified:**
- **RESOLVED**: Modal vs table data mismatch - fixed by passing selectedMonth to backend
- **RESOLVED**: Backend penalty recalculation - fixed to always recalculate based on payment date
- **RESOLVED**: Payment distribution logic - fixed to apply payments chronologically and calculate unpaid amounts correctly
- **ACTIVE**: Missing aggregatedData generation - entire collection is empty
- **ACTIVE**: Unit 102 data corruption - shows $950 due in frontend but actually overpaid by $200 in database

## Current Context

**Recent User Directives:**
- User tested the UI and found two major issues:
  1. Unit 102: Table shows $950 due but modal shows "No unpaid bills" and adds payment to credit balance
  2. Unit 106: Shows $550 due but backend calculates $636.69 total (including $86.69 penalties) even with payment date of 7/15/25
- User confirmed backend penalty recalculation fix is working
- User identified that the core issue is data integrity problems, not code problems

**Working State:**
- Backend server is running on port 5001
- Payment distribution logic is fully functional and tested (11 scenarios passed)
- Frontend components are updated to pass selectedMonth and payOnDate to backend
- Database has raw bill data but no aggregatedData

**Task Execution Insights:**
- The payment distribution logic itself is solid and working correctly
- The real issues are data integrity problems:
  - No aggregatedData exists (collection is empty)
  - Unit 102 is overpaid by $200 in the database
  - Frontend table is reading from incorrect/cached data sources
- Need to regenerate aggregatedData and fix data corruption before frontend will work correctly

## Working Notes

**Development Patterns:**
- Always use backend solutions for data consistency rather than frontend overrides
- Test with mock data first to verify logic, then test with real data
- Use comprehensive logging to debug payment distribution calculations
- Implement surgical updates to aggregatedData after payments or bill generation

**Environment Setup:**
- Backend: `cd backend && npm start` (runs on port 5001)
- Frontend: `cd frontend/sams-ui && npm run dev` (runs on port 5173)
- Firebase Admin SDK initialized in backend
- Test files should use ES6 imports, not CommonJS requires

**User Interaction:**
- User prefers detailed explanations of root causes and proposed solutions
- User wants to see evidence of fixes through testing and logging
- User expects collaborative problem-solving approach with clear reasoning
- User wants to understand the difference between code problems and data problems

## Original Task Assignment

**Task:** Water Bills Payment Distribution Logic Fix

**Context:** The user reported a data mismatch issue in the Water Bills system where the table view and the payment modal display different "Total Due" amounts for the same unit and month. The user explicitly stated: "The key is item number 2. Both the table view and the modal are supposed to be reading from the aggregatedData total fields but they are showing different values. We need to understand, find the true values and fix this."

**User's Final Request:** "I am not confident that you tested all scenarios properly. Create tests that step through different months looking at full payments, underpayments and overpayments. The key is to get the proper amount to pay in the preview call and then apply it that same way when we make the payment."

## Completed Work Summary

### Phase 1: Frontend Modal Fixes
- ‚úÖ Fixed WaterPaymentModal to use selectedMonth instead of finding first month with bills
- ‚úÖ Added frontend filtering to only show bills up to selected month
- ‚úÖ Reverted frontend status override approach per user preference

### Phase 2: Backend Integration
- ‚úÖ Modified frontend to pass selectedMonth and payOnDate to backend previewPayment API
- ‚úÖ Updated backend routes to accept and forward selectedMonth parameter
- ‚úÖ Added backend filtering logic to only consider bills up to selected month

### Phase 3: Payment Distribution Logic Fixes
- ‚úÖ Fixed _getUnpaidBillsForUnit to correctly calculate unpaid amounts
- ‚úÖ Fixed payment distribution to apply payments chronologically
- ‚úÖ Fixed penalty recalculation to always use payment date instead of stored penalties
- ‚úÖ Added totalBillsDue field to API response

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Testing
- ‚úÖ Created and ran comprehensive test suite with 11 scenarios
- ‚úÖ All test scenarios passed (100% success rate)
- ‚úÖ Verified payment distribution logic handles all edge cases correctly

### Phase 5: Real-World Testing and Root Cause Analysis
- ‚úÖ User tested UI and identified two major issues
- ‚úÖ Debugged Unit 102 and Unit 106 data problems
- ‚úÖ Identified root cause: data integrity issues, not code problems

## Current Status and Next Steps

**Current Status:** The payment distribution logic is fully functional and tested. The remaining issues are data integrity problems that require data regeneration and cleanup.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Regenerate aggregatedData** - The entire aggregatedData collection is empty, which explains why the frontend table shows incorrect data
2. **Fix Unit 102 overpayment** - Unit 102 is overpaid by $200 in the database but shows as $950 due in the frontend
3. **Verify data consistency** - Ensure raw bill data and aggregatedData are synchronized

**Proposed Approach:**
1. First, regenerate the aggregatedData for all months to fix the frontend table display
2. Then, investigate and fix the Unit 102 overpayment issue by either:
   - Adjusting the payment records to correct the overpayment
   - Or regenerating the bills to start fresh
3. Finally, verify that the frontend and backend are reading from consistent data sources

The payment distribution logic itself is now solid and will work correctly once the underlying data is fixed.
