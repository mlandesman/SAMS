# Manager Agent Handover File 3 - SAMS Communications Enhancement

## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:**
- Complete Water Bills washes array integration for PWA-Desktop compatibility (✅ COMPLETED)
- Eliminate `/api/` endpoint confusion with complete domain migration to prevent Implementation Agent errors
- Standardize baseURL configuration to single pattern (eliminate dual baseURL decision points)
- Focus on clean code with no legacy support - test data only, no production data to preserve
- Prioritize consistency for rotating Implementation Agents to reduce coding errors

**Decisions:**
- ✅ Water Bills washes array integration completed and committed (5dd5b94)
- Domain-specific routing strategy confirmed: `/water/`, `/comm/`, `/auth/`, `/user/`, `/hoadues/`, `/transactions/`, `/admin/`, `/public/`
- Single baseURL approach agreed upon - eliminate `config.api.baseUrl` vs `config.api.domainBaseUrl` confusion
- Clean data approach - no legacy count field support, washes arrays only
- Authentication contamination issue identified as root cause requiring domain isolation

**Current Development Status:**
- Backend: waterBillsService.js and waterDataService.js updated to process washes arrays
- Frontend: Desktop UI converted from count inputs to [Washes] button with modal
- PWA: Already using washes array format
- Compatibility: Both desktop and PWA now use identical washes data structure

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- ✅ Water Bills backend washes array processing → COMPLETED and working
- ✅ Desktop UI washes button → COMPLETED with WashModal component
- ⏳ Bills screen Washes column → Ready for implementation (depends on completed backend)
- ⏳ History screen wash indicators → Ready for implementation (depends on completed backend)
- ❌ API domain migration → BLOCKED by baseURL standardization requirements
- ❌ baseURL configuration cleanup → Required before domain migration

**Coordination Insights:**
- Implementation Agents confused by dual baseURL patterns leading to `/api/api/` errors
- Domain-specific routing prevents authentication cross-contamination (critical after Agent broke all modules 3 weeks ago)
- Water Bills functionality fully working with washes arrays - no more count fields needed
- User prefers compartmentalized task assignments for Implementation Agents
- APM v0.4 Manager Agent handover protocols working effectively

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:**
1. **HIGH PRIORITY: API Domain Migration + baseURL Standardization**
   - Task File: "Task Assignment: Complete API Domain Migration + baseURL Standardization"
   - Scope: Eliminate ALL `/api/` module-specific endpoints, standardize to single baseURL
   - Approach: Phase 1 analysis, then domain-by-domain migration (/auth/, /user/, /hoadues/, /transactions/, /admin/)

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Complete Water Bills UI Enhancement**
   - Task File: "Task Assignment: Water Bills UI Final Phases" 
   - Scope: Add Washes column to Bills screen, wash indicators to History screen
   - Dependencies: Backend washes array support completed

3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Maintenance User Role Integration**
   - Task File: "Task Assignment: Integrate new Maintenance user role into PWA"
   - Scope: PWA role system updates for new user type

4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Propane Tank Readings**
   - Task File: "Task Assignment: Model Propane Tank readings based on Water Meter Readings for MTC"
   - Scope: Create new readings system following Water Meter patterns

**Blocked Items:**
- None - all tasks ready for Implementation Agent assignment

**Phase Transition:**
Current phase focuses on infrastructure cleanup (API migration, baseURL standardization) before expanding to new features. Critical foundation work to prevent Implementation Agent confusion.

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:**
- Water Bills: Backend services in `/backend/services/waterBillsService.js`, `/backend/services/waterDataService.js`
- Desktop UI: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/water/WaterReadingEntry.jsx`, `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/water/WashModal.jsx`
- PWA: `/frontend/mobile-app/src/components/WaterMeterEntryNew.jsx`
- API Configuration: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/config/index.js` (needs single baseURL), `/frontend/mobile-app/src/api/`
- Slash Commands: `/.claude/settings.json` (contains `/newIA` command for spawning Implementation Agents)

**Coordination Strategies:**
- Use `/newIA` command for efficient Implementation Agent spawning
- Assign compartmentalized tasks with specific technical requirements
- Focus on eliminating Implementation Agent decision points (dual baseURL, mixed endpoint patterns)
- Complete one domain migration before moving to next for systematic approach
- Test domain isolation to prevent authentication cross-contamination

**User Preferences:**
- Direct communication style, minimal explanations unless requested
- Prefers clean code with no legacy support (test data environment)
- Values systematic, complete implementation over partial features
- Wants Implementation Agent consistency and error reduction as top priority
- Focused on go-live readiness with professional quality standards
- Appreciates compartmentalized task assignments for rotating agents

## Critical Implementation Context
**Water Bills Washes Array Success:**
- ✅ Backend now processes `washes: [{type: 'car'|'boat', date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', cost: 100|200}]` format
- ✅ Desktop UI has [Washes] button with color-coded states (empty vs populated)
- ✅ WashModal provides CRUD operations with auth/audit integration
- ✅ PWA and Desktop use identical data structures
- ✅ Bills service calculates from arrays, preserves both arrays and counts in output

**API Domain Migration Critical Context:**
- **Root Problem:** Agent 3 weeks ago made AVII-specific water auth at `/api/` level, breaking ALL other modules
- **Current State:** Mixed patterns cause `/api/api/` double-prefix errors in Implementation Agent code
- **Solution:** Complete domain separation with authentication boundaries per domain
- **baseURL Issue:** Dual configuration (`baseUrl` vs `domainBaseUrl`) creates decision fatigue for agents

**Technical Architecture Status:**
- Water domain: `/water/` - ✅ Complete and working
- Communications domain: `/comm/` - ✅ Complete and working  
- Auth domain: `/api/auth/` - ❌ Needs migration to `/auth/`
- User domain: `/api/users/` - ❌ Needs migration to `/user/`
- HOA domain: `/api/clients/{id}/hoa/` - ❌ Needs migration to `/hoadues/`
- Other domains: Multiple `/api/` patterns need domain classification

## Go-Live Requirements Progress
**Infrastructure Foundation:**
- ✅ Water Bills PWA-Desktop compatibility achieved
- ✅ Washes array data structure standardized
- ⚠️ API domain migration required for agent consistency
- ⚠️ baseURL standardization required for error prevention

**Remaining Development Tasks:**
- API endpoint domain migration (prevent agent confusion)
- Water Bills UI completion (Bills column, History indicators)  
- Maintenance role integration (PWA user system)
- Propane Tank readings (new feature for MTC)

**Ready for Implementation Agent Assignment:**
All blocked dependencies resolved. Next Manager Agent can immediately assign tasks to Implementation Agents using the detailed task specifications provided.

## Session Handover Status
**Manager Agent 3 Context Transfer Complete:**
- Water Bills washes array integration successfully completed and committed
- Task assignments prepared for Implementation Agent execution
- API domain migration strategy defined and ready for implementation
- User preferences and coordination strategies documented
- Critical technical context preserved for next Manager Agent

**Immediate Next Action:** Assign API Domain Migration task to Implementation Agent using `/newIA` command with the prepared task specification.
