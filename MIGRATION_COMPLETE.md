## 🔧 APM Configuration

All APM commands now use correct Drive paths:

### Cursor Commands Working:
- `/newIA` - Initialize Implementation Agent
- `/newMA` - Initialize Manager Agent  
- `/renewIA` - Renew Implementation Agent
- `/renewMA` - Renew Manager Agent

### APM Docs Location:
```
/Users/michael/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-michael@landesman.com/My Drive/Sandyland/SAMS-Docs
```

### Quick Reference Files:
- `APM_PATHS.md` - Complete path documentation
- `.cursor/APM_QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide

## 🎯 What's Next

### Ready to Use:
1. **Start developing** - Services are running
2. **Use Cursor** - APM commands work
3. **Test features** - Water Bills are solid
4. **Access docs** - Use `sams-docs` alias

### Optional Cleanup:
When you're ready, archive the old Drive folder:
```bash
cd "/Users/michael/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-michael@landesman.com/My Drive/Sandyland/SAMS"
./CLEANUP_DRIVE_FOLDER.sh
```
