# Exchange Rates Web App Integration

## Overview

The SAMS Exchange Rates system provides automated daily updates and admin management tools integrated directly into the web application. This system ensures that all multi-currency transactions have accurate, up-to-date exchange rates without manual intervention.

## ✅ Completed Features (June 2025)

### 🔄 Automated Daily Updates
- **Trigger**: Automatically runs when users log into the SAMS web app
- **Method**: Gap-filling from last known date to today
- **Scope**: All supported currencies (USD, CAD, EUR, COP vs MXN)
- **Frequency**: Once per login session (doesn't repeat if user stays logged in)
- **Silent Operation**: Runs in background without blocking user interface

### 🛠️ Admin Management Interface
**Location**: List Management Activity → Exchange Rates Tab

**Available Tools**:
1. **Current Status Check**
   - View today's exchange rate availability
   - See last update timestamp and data source
   - Display all available currencies with current rates

2. **Quick Update**
   - Fill gaps from last known date to today
   - Safe, fast operation ideal for daily maintenance
   - Uses individual API calls with fallback handling

3. **Fill Recent Gaps**
   - Fill missing dates within the last month
   - Useful after system downtime or API issues
   - Targets specific date range for efficiency

4. **Dry Run Test**
   - Preview what would be updated without making changes
   - Safe testing before running actual updates
   - Shows exactly which dates would be processed

5. **Full Bulk Replace**
   - Complete rebuild of all exchange rates from 2020+
   - Uses Banxico's bulk historical data endpoint
   - Takes several minutes, requires admin confirmation
   - Nuclear option for data corruption recovery

### 🔌 Backend API Integration
**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/exchange-rates/daily-update` - Automated login trigger
- `POST /api/exchange-rates/manual-update` - Admin panel operations
- `GET /api/exchange-rates/check` - Status checking

**CORS Configuration**: 
- Properly configured for credentials-based requests
- Allows `http://localhost:5173` origin for development
- Supports production domains when deployed

### 📊 Real-time Status Monitoring
- Live status checks show data availability for current date
- Last update timestamps with source attribution
- Visual indicators for data freshness and completeness
- Error reporting and success confirmations

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
```
AuthContext.jsx
├── Triggers daily update on login
├── Handles success/error states
└── Provides user feedback

ExchangeRatesList.jsx
├── Admin UI component
├── Status checking and display
├── Manual update controls
└── Progress indicators

ListManagementView.jsx
├── Tab integration
├── Client-specific access control
└── Responsive layout
```

### Backend Architecture
```
exchangeRatesController.js
├── dailyUpdate() - Login trigger endpoint
├── manualUpdate() - Admin operations
└── checkRates() - Status queries

exchangeRates.js (routes)
├── POST /daily-update
├── POST /manual-update
└── GET /check

bulkImportExchangeRates.js (core engine)
├── Multiple operation modes
├── API rate limiting
├── Error handling
└── Firestore integration
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Login** → AuthContext triggers daily update
2. **Daily Update** → Backend calls core import script
3. **Core Script** → Fetches data from Banxico/Colombian APIs
4. **Data Processing** → Validates and transforms exchange rates
5. **Firestore Storage** → Saves to `exchangeRates` collection
6. **Status Response** → Returns success/error to frontend
7. **User Feedback** → Console logs and UI notifications

## Configuration

### Client Access Control
Exchange Rates tab is enabled per client in Firestore:
```javascript
// clients/{clientId}/config/lists
{
  "vendor": true,
  "category": true,
  "method": true,
  "unit": true,
  "exchangerates": true  // ← Enable Exchange Rates tab
}
```

### Supported Currencies
- **USD** (US Dollar) - Banxico series SF43718
- **CAD** (Canadian Dollar) - Banxico series SF60632  
- **EUR** (Euro) - Banxico series SF46410
- **COP** (Colombian Peso) - Colombian Government API

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Banxico (Bank of Mexico) API
- **Secondary**: Colombian Government API for COP rates
- **Bulk Historical**: Banxico bulk endpoint for full replacements
- **Fallback**: Hardcoded approximate rates if APIs fail

## Error Handling

### CORS Resolution
- **Issue**: Frontend credentials requests blocked by wildcard CORS
- **Solution**: Explicit origin configuration in backend
- **Result**: Successful API communication with authentication

### API Failure Handling
- Individual currency API failures don't stop the process
- Missing data is logged but doesn't prevent other currencies
- Network timeouts are caught and reported
- Invalid responses are skipped with warnings

### User Experience
- All operations provide clear success/error feedback
- Loading states prevent multiple simultaneous operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Detailed console logging for troubleshooting

## Deployment Considerations

### Development Environment
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- Backend: `http://localhost:5001` (Express server)
- CORS: Configured for localhost development

### Production Deployment
- Update CORS configuration for production domains
- Consider moving daily updates to cloud functions for 24/7 operation
- Monitor API rate limits and usage patterns
- Set up logging and alerting for failed updates

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Cloud Function Migration**: Move daily updates to serverless functions
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Dashboard for exchange rate data health
3. **API Rate Optimization**: Batch requests and caching strategies
4. **Historical Analysis**: Trends and reporting features
5. **Multi-tenant Support**: Per-client currency preferences

### Migration Path
- Current web app integration provides solid foundation
- Cloud function deployment can run parallel to web app triggers
- Gradual migration without service interruption
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing data

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- Daily update success rate
- API response times and failures
- Data freshness (days since last update)
- User adoption of admin tools

### Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Monitor backend logs for API failures
- Verify Firestore data integrity
- Test individual currency endpoints

### Regular Maintenance
- Monitor API key validity and usage limits
- Update currency mappings as needed
- Review and optimize bulk import performance
- Validate data accuracy against official sources

## Quick Reference

### For End Users
- Exchange rates update automatically when you log in
- No manual action required for daily operations
- Contact admin if rates appear outdated

### For Administrators  
- Use List Management → Exchange Rates for manual control
- "Quick Update" for daily maintenance
- "Bulk Replace" only for emergencies
- Monitor console logs for issues

### For Developers
- Core logic in `/scripts/bulkImportExchangeRates.js`
- Frontend API in `/frontend/sams-ui/src/api/exchangeRates.js`
- Backend endpoints in `/backend/controllers/exchangeRatesController.js`
- Test endpoints with `/scripts/testExchangeRatesEndpoints.js`
