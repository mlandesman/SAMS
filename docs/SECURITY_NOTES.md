# SAMS Security Notes

## Firebase Authentication (Updated June 2, 2025)

### API Key Issues

We've encountered an issue with the Firebase API key not being valid. This was fixed by:

1. Updating the API key in `firebaseClient.js`
2. Adding proper error handling for authentication failures
3. Implementing checks for authenticated state before CRUD operations

### Current Authentication Approach

The application now uses Firebase Email/Password Authentication, providing a more secure approach than the previously implemented anonymous authentication. Key features of our current implementation:

1. **Session Security**: Using `browserSessionPersistence` to ensure authentication state is cleared when browser is closed
2. **Enforced Login**: Users must log in after browser restart or application reload
3. **Client Selection Security**: Client data is cleared on startup and browser close
4. **Login Form**: Custom branded login form with proper validation and error handling

These changes significantly improve security for financial data by ensuring that:

1. **No Persistent Sessions**: Authentication state does not persist between browser sessions
2. **Fresh Authentication Required**: Users must authenticate each time they open the application
3. **Client Data Protection**: Client selection is cleared to prevent unauthorized access

### Security Improvements (June 8, 2025)

1. **Implemented Proper User Authentication**:
   - Added email/password authentication with Firebase
   - Created branded login screen with validation
   - Added session security with `browserSessionPersistence`
   - Implemented proper logout and session clearing

### Remaining Security Recommendations

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Define roles (Admin, Manager, Viewer)
   - Configure Firestore rules based on user roles
   - Limit UI functionality based on permissions

3. **Secure API Keys**:
   - Store API keys in environment variables (.env files)
   - Use server-side authentication where possible
   - Keep service account keys secure (never commit to public repositories)

4. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all important operations with user information
   - Implement activity monitoring for sensitive actions
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

## Firestore Security Rules

Current rules:
```
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /clients/{clientId}/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

These rules allow anyone to read data but require authentication to write data. This is a minimal security approach and should be enhanced with:

1. **Fine-grained Access Control**:
   ```
   match /clients/{clientId}/{document=**} {
     allow read: if true;
     allow create: if request.auth != null && hasRole('admin', 'manager');
     allow update: if request.auth != null && hasRole('admin', 'manager');
     allow delete: if request.auth != null && hasRole('admin');
   }
   ```

2. **Data Validation Rules**:
   ```
   match /clients/{clientId}/transactions/{transactionId} {
     allow create: if request.auth != null 
       && request.resource.data.amount is number
       && request.resource.data.date is timestamp;
   }
   ```

## Next Steps for Security Enhancement

1. ✅ Migrate from anonymous auth to full user authentication (Completed June 5, 2025)
2. ✅ Implement proper session security (Completed June 8, 2025)
3. Implement user management UI
4. Add role-based permissions
5. Enhance Firestore security rules with validation
6. Set up audit logging for sensitive operations
7. Implement client data import validation and sanitization for new client onboarding
