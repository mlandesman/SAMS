# Transaction Management Implementation

This document describes the implementation of transaction management functionality (Add, Edit, Delete) in the SAMS application.

## Overview

The transaction management functionality allows users to:
- View a list of transactions with proper filtering
- Add new expense transactions
- Edit existing transactions
- Delete transactions
- Select transactions in the table with visual feedback

## Components Modified

1. **TransactionTable.jsx**
   - Added row selection capability
   - Visual indication of selected rows
   - Integration with TransactionsContext

2. **TransactionsContext.jsx**
   - Added state management for selected transactions
   - Implemented CRUD operations via Firebase
   - Enhanced action handler to support all transaction operations

3. **TransactionsView.jsx**
   - Updated to use the transaction context
   - Added delete functionality 
   - Implemented disable/enable for contextual buttons based on selection
   - Added modal integration for expense entry/edit

4. **firebaseClient.js**
   - Added anonymous Firebase authentication to fix permission issues
   - Better error handling for database operations

5. **ActionBar.css**
   - Added styling for disabled buttons
   - Improved visual feedback for interactions

## Firebase Authentication

Anonymous authentication is used to allow database operations without requiring explicit user login. This is implemented in `firebaseClient.js` using Firebase's `signInAnonymously` method.

```javascript
import { getAuth, signInAnonymously } from 'firebase/auth';

// Initialize Firebase authentication
const auth = getAuth(app);

// Sign in anonymously to allow database access
signInAnonymously(auth)
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Successfully signed in anonymously');
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error signing in anonymously:', error);
  });
```

## Transaction Operations

### Add Transaction

1. User clicks "Add Expense" button in ActionBar
2. ExpenseEntryModal opens with empty form
3. User fills in transaction details
4. On submit, data is passed to the `addTransaction` function in TransactionsContext
5. Transaction is created in Firestore
6. UI refreshes to show the new transaction

### Edit Transaction

1. User selects a transaction from the table (row becomes highlighted)
2. User clicks "Edit Entry" button in ActionBar
3. ExpenseEntryModal opens with selected transaction data pre-filled
4. User modifies transaction details
5. On submit, data is passed to the `editTransaction` function in TransactionsContext
6. Transaction is updated in Firestore
7. UI refreshes to show the updated transaction

### Delete Transaction

1. User selects a transaction from the table (row becomes highlighted)
2. User clicks "Delete Entry" button in ActionBar
3. Confirmation modal appears
4. If user confirms, transaction is deleted from Firestore using `deleteTransaction` function
5. UI refreshes with transaction removed

## UI Enhancements

1. **Row Selection**
   - Selected rows have a highlighted background and border
   - Cursor changes to pointer on hoverable rows

2. **Button States**
   - Edit, Delete, and Clear buttons are disabled when no transaction is selected
   - Disabled buttons have reduced opacity and different styling

## Firestore Rules

The application assumes the following Firestore rules are in place:

```
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /clients/{clientId}/{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

These rules allow anyone to read data but require authentication to write data.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add proper user authentication with role-based access
2. Implement batch operations for bulk editing/deleting
3. Add transaction search functionality
4. Add transaction export to CSV/PDF
