# Transaction Management Implementation Change Log

## June 13, 2025 - List Management UI Refactor & StatusBar Architecture

### Major List Management UI Overhaul
1. **Layout Standardization**
   - Refactored all List Management screens (Vendors, Categories, Payment Methods) to match TransactionsView layout
   - Moved ActionBar above tabs with consistent dark green header row
   - Implemented unified status bar at bottom with magnifying glass icon and "Entries (n)" count

2. **Interaction Model Changes**
   - Removed all row-level action buttons for cleaner interface
   - Implemented double-click to open detail view (consistent with TransactionsView)
   - Centralized all actions (Add/Edit/Delete/View Details) in ActionBar

3. **New StatusBar Architecture**
   - Created generic `StatusBarContext` for scalable status information sharing
   - Implemented modular status publishing system - each module publishes its own status
   - Designed for future scalability (Budgets, Projects, etc. can use same pattern)
   - Maintains module scope isolation while enabling shared status display

### Component Architecture Improvements
1. **Reusable StatusBar Component**
   - Built customizable center content system via children or route detection
   - Always shows date/time (left) and connection status (right)
   - Dynamic center content based on current module/route
   - Future-ready for any module type (lists, transactions, projects, budgets)

2. **List Management Components**
   - Created `ListManagementStatusContent` for status bar center content
   - Updated `ModernBaseList` to report filtered item counts to parent
   - Implemented real-time search filtering with count updates
   - Added proper cleanup to prevent context pollution

3. **Context Management**
   - Each module maintains its own scoped context (ListManagementContext, etc.)
   - Global StatusBarContext only handles display information
   - Prevents scope pollution while enabling cross-module status sharing
   - Optimized with `useCallback` and `useMemo` to prevent infinite render loops

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented change detection in StatusBarContext to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Added proper useCallback wrapping for event handlers
   - Optimized context updates with JSON comparison for change detection

2. **Search Functionality**
   - Implemented real-time filtering across searchable columns
   - Connected GlobalSearch component to actual list filtering
   - Added proper search state management with cleanup

### Future Architecture Benefits
- **Modular**: Each feature has scoped contexts (BudgetsContext, ProjectsContext, etc.)
- **Scalable**: New modules publish status via: `setStatusInfo({ type: 'budgets', budgetCount: 12 })`
- **Clean**: Business logic in module contexts, display logic in StatusBar context
- **Flexible**: Different modules can show different status information types

## June 10, 2025 - Three-Tier Filtering System & UI Improvements

### Major Transaction Filtering Overhaul
1. **Three-Tier Filtering System Implementation**
   - **Global Search (Tier 1)**: Real-time search across all loaded transaction data via magnifying glass icon
   - **Date Range Filter (Tier 2)**: Dynamic date filtering with Firestore refetch via status bar dropdown
   - **Advanced Filter Modal (Tier 3)**: Multi-field filtering with amount ranges, categories, vendors, descriptions, and notes
   - Integrated all three tiers to work seamlessly together with shared state management

2. **New Filtering Architecture**
   - Created `TransactionFiltersContext.jsx` for unified filter state management
   - Implemented `useTransactionFilters.js` hook for filter operations
   - Synchronized new filtering system with legacy `TransactionsContext` for data refetching
   - Ensured date range changes trigger fresh Firestore queries to handle historical data (e.g., 2024 transactions)

3. **Status Bar Redesign**
   - Restructured layout: Date/time (left) + Search/Filter (center) + Connection status (right)
   - Consolidated search and filter functionality in center area for better UX
   - Moved magnifying glass icon to center next to filter name for logical grouping
   - Enhanced visual hierarchy and improved accessibility
