- Database queries automatically filter results based on user's client access
- Cross-client data access is prevented at the database query level

### **Client Context Enforcement**
- Users can only operate within their assigned client properties
- Client selection is restricted to user's authorized clients
- All data operations are scoped to the user's current client context

### **Audit & Monitoring**
- All user actions are logged with user identification and client context
