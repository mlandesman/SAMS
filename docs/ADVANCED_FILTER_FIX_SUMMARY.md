# Advanced Filter Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Advanced Filter was searching only current filtered data
**Problem**: The Advanced Filter modal was receiving only the currently filtered transactions (e.g., Current Month), not ALL transactions.

**Solution**: 
- Added new state `allTransactionsUnfiltered` to store ALL transactions
- Fetch ALL transactions when Advanced Filter modal opens
- Pass unfiltered transactions to the modal

### 2. Units dropdown not populating
**Problem**: The units dropdown in Advanced Filter showed "All units" but no individual units to select.

**Solution**:
- Pass the `units` array from TransactionsView to AdvancedFilterModal
- Modified AdvancedFilterModal to handle unit objects (extracting unitNumber/unit/id)
- Units are now properly populated from the units data fetched for the client

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **TransactionsView.jsx**:
   - Added `allTransactionsUnfiltered` state
   - Added effect to fetch ALL transactions when modal opens
   - Pass `allTransactionsUnfiltered` and `units` to AdvancedFilterModal
   - Clear unfiltered transactions when client changes

2. **AdvancedFilterModal.jsx**:
   - Modified unit handling to extract unit numbers from objects
   - Now properly uses the units prop when available

## How It Works Now

1. When user clicks "Filter" button â†’ Advanced Filter modal opens
2. Component fetches ALL transactions for the client (no date filtering)
3. Units are already loaded from the units API
4. Advanced Filter shows:
   - All vendors from ALL transactions
   - All categories from ALL transactions  
   - All units from the units data
   - All accounts from ALL transactions

5. User can filter across the entire transaction history, not just current view

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Clear browser cache/localStorage
2. Navigate to Transactions (will show Current Month)
3. Click Filter button
4. Verify:
   - Units dropdown shows all unit numbers
   - Selecting a vendor/category shows results from all time periods
   - Filter results are not limited to current month

## Performance Note

Fetching all transactions happens only when the Advanced Filter modal is opened, not on initial page load. This maintains the performance benefit of the "Current Month" default while giving full search capability when needed.
