## Test Case 1: Delete Single Bill Payment with Penalty

### Setup
**Identify a test payment:**
1. Go to Water Bills module
2. Find a paid bill for any unit (e.g., Unit 203, June 2026)
3. Note the payment details:
   - Unit ID
   - Month/Bill ID (e.g., "2026-06")
   - Amount paid (e.g., $2150 = $2000 base + $150 penalty)
   - Transaction ID

### Test Procedure
1. **Before Delete - Capture Baseline:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Navigate to Transactions View
   - Take screenshot of transaction list
   - Note the bill status in Water Bills view (should be "PAID" or "PARTIAL")
   - Check aggregatedData in Firebase Console if possible

2. **Execute Delete:**
   - In Transactions View, find the Water Bills payment transaction
   - Click delete button
   - Confirm deletion

3. **Monitor Console Output:**
   Look for these log messages in backend console:
   ```
   🧹 [BACKEND] Processing Water Bills cleanup write operations...
   💧 [BACKEND] Reversing payment for water bill...
   🔄 [BACKEND] Starting surgical penalty recalculation...
   🔄 [BACKEND] Fiscal year extracted: 2026 from bill ID: 2026-06
   🔄 [BACKEND] Affected units/months for surgical update: [...]
   ✅ [BACKEND] Surgical penalty recalculation completed successfully...
   ```

### Expected Results
✅ **Transaction deleted successfully**
✅ **Bill status returns to UNPAID in Water Bills view**
✅ **paidAmount reset to 0**
✅ **basePaid reset to 0**
✅ **penaltyPaid reset to 0**
✅ **lastPayment cleared**
✅ **Console shows surgical update success**
✅ **Penalty recalculated in aggregatedData** (check Firebase Console or refresh Water Bills)
✅ **UI shows updated penalty amounts after refresh**

### Verification Steps
1. **Check Transaction List:**
   - Payment transaction is gone
   - Account balance adjusted correctly

2. **Check Water Bills:**
   - Navigate back to Water Bills module
   - Find the bill that was paid
   - Status should be "UNPAID" (or "PARTIAL" if partially paid)
   - Paid amounts should be $0 (or reduced if partial)
   - Penalty amounts should be recalculated

3. **Check Backend Logs:**
   - Confirm surgical update completed
   - No errors in penalty recalculation
   - Performance under 2 seconds

4. **Check Firebase Console (Optional):**
   - Navigate to: `clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/[BILL-ID]`
   - Verify `bills.units.[UNIT-ID].paidAmount` is correct
   - Check `clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/aggregatedData`
   - Verify penalties updated for the affected month

---

## Test Case 2: Delete Multiple Bills Payment

### Setup
**Identify a payment that covered multiple bills:**
1. Look for a transaction that paid multiple months (e.g., June + July)
2. Note all affected bills
3. Record current status of each bill

### Test Procedure
1. **Before Delete:**
   - Document all bills covered by the payment
   - Note their status and amounts
   - Screenshot Water Bills summary

2. **Execute Delete:**
   - Delete the transaction covering multiple bills
   - Monitor backend console

3. **Monitor Console for Multiple Updates:**
   ```
   🔄 [BACKEND] Starting surgical penalty recalculation for 2 bill(s)...
   🔄 [BACKEND] Affected units/months: [{unitId: "203", monthId: "2026-06"}, {unitId: "203", monthId: "2026-07"}]
   ✅ [BACKEND] Surgical penalty recalculation completed...
   ```

### Expected Results
✅ **All bills returned to unpaid status**
✅ **All months have penalties recalculated**
✅ **aggregatedData updated for all affected months**
✅ **affectedUnitsAndMonths array contains all months in logs**

### Verification
- Check each bill individually
- Verify all returned to correct status
- Confirm penalties recalculated for each month

## Test Case 3: Delete Payment with Credit Usage

### Setup
**Find a payment that used credit balance:**
1. Look for transactions with credit balance usage
2. Note credit balance before payment
3. Note credit balance after payment

### Test Procedure
1. **Before Delete:**
   - Check current credit balance for unit
   - Document how much credit was used

2. **Execute Delete:**
   - Delete the transaction
   - Watch for credit balance reversal logs

3. **Monitor Console:**
   ```
   💰 [BACKEND] Reversed water payment credit changes...
   🔄 [BACKEND] Starting surgical penalty recalculation...
   ✅ [BACKEND] Surgical penalty recalculation completed...
   ```

### Expected Results
✅ **Bill returned to unpaid**
✅ **Credit balance restored correctly**
✅ **Penalties recalculated despite credit involvement**
✅ **Credit history updated in HOA Dues**

### Verification
- Check HOA Dues credit balance
- Should be restored to pre-payment amount
- Credit history should show reversal entry
- Bills should have correct penalty amounts

---

## Test Case 4: Performance Verification

### Metrics to Capture
During any of the above tests, measure:
1. **Total deletion time** (from click to completion)
2. **Surgical update time** (from backend logs)
3. **UI refresh time** (how long until changes visible)

### Expected Performance
✅ **Total operation: < 2 seconds**
✅ **Surgical update: < 1 second** (proven from Oct 13-14 work)
✅ **UI refresh: immediate** (cache invalidation should trigger)

### How to Measure
1. **Backend logs show timing:**
   ```
   ✅ [SURGICAL_UPDATE] Surgical update completed for 1 units in 503ms
   ```

2. **Browser DevTools Network tab:**
   - Monitor API call duration
   - Check for cache invalidation requests

3. **User experience:**
   - Should feel instant
   - No lag or freezing
   - Data updates immediately on refresh

## Error Scenarios to Test

### Scenario 1: Surgical Update Fails
**Simulate:** Temporarily break `updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()` call

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Transaction still deleted successfully
- ✅ Bills returned to unpaid status
- ⚠️ Console shows error but doesn't fail delete
- ⚠️ Warning message about manual refresh

**Recovery:**
- Manual page refresh
- Or full recalculation of aggregatedData

### Scenario 2: No Bills Found
**Simulate:** Delete a Water Bills transaction with no associated bills

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Transaction deleted
- ℹ️ No surgical update triggered (no bills to reverse)
- ✅ No errors

### Scenario 3: Invalid Bill ID Format
**Test:** If a bill has non-standard ID format

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Transaction deleted
- ✅ Bills reversed
- ⚠️ Surgical update may fail gracefully
- ✅ Delete still succeeds

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Surgical update not triggered
**Check:**
- Is `waterCleanupExecuted` true?
- Does `waterBillDocs.length > 0`?
- Look for log: "Starting surgical penalty recalculation..."

**Fix:**
- Verify Water Bills cleanup ran successfully
- Check that bills were found during cleanup phase

### Issue: Fiscal year extraction fails
**Check:**
- Bill ID format (should be "YYYY-MM")
- Log: "Fiscal year extracted: ..."

**Fix:**
- Verify bill IDs in Firebase
- Check that first bill has valid ID

### Issue: aggregatedData not updated
**Check:**
- Did surgical update complete? (✅ log message)
- Is aggregatedData document present in Firebase?
- Check for errors in surgical update function

**Fix:**
- Manual refresh of Water Bills view
- Check Firebase Console for aggregatedData
- Run full recalculation if needed

### Issue: Penalties still wrong after delete
**Check:**
- Was surgical update successful?
- Did cache invalidation work?
- Is UI fetching old cached data?

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Verify aggregatedData in Firebase
- Re-run surgical update if needed
