# **UI Layout Standards (Updated June 2025)**

## **List Management Interface Standard**
All list management screens (Vendors, Categories, Payment Methods, Units, etc.) follow this standardized layout:

### **Layout Structure**
1. **ActionBar (Top)**: Dark green header with action buttons
   - Add New (plus icon)
   - Edit (pencil icon) - requires selection
   - Delete (trash icon) - requires selection  
   - View Details (eye icon) - requires selection
2. **Tabs (Below ActionBar)**: Different list types when multiple lists available
3. **Data Table (Center)**: Clean table with no row-level action buttons
4. **StatusBar (Bottom)**: Consistent across all views
   - Date/time (left)
   - Module-specific status (center) - e.g., "üîç Entries (n)" for lists
   - Connection status (right)

### **Interaction Model**
- **Single-click**: Select row (highlights row)
- **Double-click**: Open detail view modal
- **No row-level buttons**: All actions through ActionBar
- **Real-time search**: Via magnifying glass icon in status bar
- **Real-time count**: Shows filtered item count in status bar

### **StatusBar Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Each module publishes its own status information
- **Context Isolation**: Module contexts stay scoped, status shared via StatusBarContext
- **Future-Ready**: New modules (Budgets, Projects) follow same pattern
- **Example**: `setStatusInfo({ type: 'budgets', budgetCount: 12, currentBudget: 'Q4 2025' })`

## **Design Consistency Rules**
1. **All list screens** must follow the ActionBar ‚Üí Tabs ‚Üí Table ‚Üí StatusBar layout
2. **No row-level action buttons** - actions only in ActionBar
3. **Double-click for details** - consistent interaction model
4. **StatusBar integration** - every module should publish appropriate status info
5. **Search integration** - GlobalSearch component filters list data in real-time
