**Issue ID**: ISSUE-20250803_1040  
**Created**: 2025-08-03 10:40:00  
**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM  
**Module**: Frontend - Digital Receipt  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ OPEN

## Problem Description

The Digital Receipt Preview modal is failing to send receipt emails with the error:
```
Failed to send receipt email: No valid authorization header
```

## Error Details

From the console logs visible in the screenshot:
- Error occurs when trying to send email via API endpoint: `DigitalReceipt.jsx:214`
- Sending receipt email for client: `email.js:54`
- POST request to `http://localhost:5001/api/clients/MTC/email/send-receipt` returns 401 (Forbidden)
- The error indicates missing or invalid authorization header

## Context

- Occurs in the HOA Dues view when attempting to email a payment receipt
- The receipt preview displays correctly but fails when sending
- Email address is properly captured (ms@landesman.com)
- The "Ready for email integration" checkbox is checked

## Technical Details

**Affected Component**: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/DigitalReceipt.jsx`  
**API Endpoint**: `/api/clients/:clientId/email/send-receipt`  
**Error Line**: Line 214 in DigitalReceipt.jsx

## Expected Behavior

When clicking "Send Receipt" in the Digital Receipt modal, the system should:
1. Include proper authorization headers in the API request
2. Successfully send the receipt email
3. Show a success notification
4. Close the modal

## Actual Behavior

The request fails with a 401 Forbidden error due to missing authorization header.

## Potential Root Causes

1. Authorization token not being included in the email API request
2. Email service not properly configured with auth credentials
3. Missing middleware to attach auth headers for email endpoints
4. Token expiration or invalid token format

## Recommended Investigation

1. Check if auth headers are being attached to the email request in DigitalReceipt.jsx
2. Verify the email endpoint expects and validates authorization
3. Ensure the auth token is available in the component context
4. Check backend email route authentication middleware

## Impact

- Users cannot send digital receipts via email
- Manual workaround required (downloading and emailing separately)
- Affects user experience and efficiency

## Related Information

- This is NOT related to the fiscal year implementation
- Should be addressed after fiscal year project completion
- May require review of authentication flow for email services

**Note**: This issue is logged for tracking but should NOT be worked on until after the fiscal year implementation is complete.
