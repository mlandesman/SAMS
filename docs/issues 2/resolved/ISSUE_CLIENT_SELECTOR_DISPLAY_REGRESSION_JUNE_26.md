# üö® ISSUE: Client Selector Display Regression

**Issue ID**: CLIENT-SELECTOR-001  
**Date Reported**: June 26, 2025  
**Reporter**: Project Owner  
**Priority**: üü° **HIGH** - User Experience Impact  
**Category**: Bug - Display Regression  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üìã **ISSUE DESCRIPTION**

The Client Selector component is no longer displaying the full client information that was previously shown. The component appears to be showing minimal or no client details instead of the expected rich display with logo, address, and client information.

### **Expected Behavior**
Client Selector should display:
- Client logo/avatar
- Client name
- Client address information
- Full client details in a visually appealing format

### **Current Behavior**
Client Selector shows reduced or missing information:
- Missing client logos
- Missing address information
- Reduced client details display
- Potentially showing only client names or basic info

### **Visual Evidence**
User provided Image #1 showing the current broken state vs expected display.

## üîç **ANALYSIS**

### **Likely Root Cause**
This appears to be a regression introduced during yesterday's bug fixes. Possible causes:
1. **CSS/Styling Changes** - Layout or styling modifications affected display
2. **Data Structure Changes** - Client data structure modified breaking display logic
3. **Component Updates** - ClientSelector component accidentally modified
4. **Props/Data Flow** - Changes to how client data is passed to the component

### **Risk Assessment**
- **User Experience**: HIGH - Clients may not be easily identifiable
- **Professional Appearance**: HIGH - Reduced visual polish
- **Functionality**: MEDIUM - Basic selection may still work
- **Launch Impact**: MEDIUM - Should be fixed before production use

## üïµÔ∏è **INVESTIGATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Identify Changes**
1. **Git History Review**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="yesterday" -- "*Client*" "*client*"
   git log --oneline --since="yesterday" -- "*Selector*" "*selector*"
   ```

2. **Component File Analysis**
   - `ClientSelector.jsx` or equivalent component
   - Parent components that render ClientSelector
   - CSS/styling files for client display

3. **Data Flow Investigation**
   - Check client data structure in recent changes
   - Verify API responses for client information
   - Review props passed to ClientSelector

### **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Compare Working vs Broken State**
   - Identify specific elements missing
   - Check console for JavaScript errors
   - Review network requests for client data

2. **Code Comparison**
   - Compare current ClientSelector with working version
   - Check related styling and CSS changes
   - Review any client data model changes
