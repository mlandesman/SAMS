# PWA Mobile App Resolution Summary

## Overview
After 3 days of intensive troubleshooting, we successfully resolved critical PWA mobile app issues that were preventing proper functionality on mobile.sams.sandyland.com.mx. The root cause was discovered to be incorrect backend URL configuration in Vercel environment variables, compounded by data structure mismatches between frontend and backend.

## Initial Issues (Day 1-2)
1. **Password Reset** - 405 Method Not Allowed errors
2. **Exchange Rates Calculator** - 404 errors when fetching /api/user/clients
3. **Add Expenses** - CORS policy blocking API requests
4. **General CORS Errors** - Persistent despite correct backend configuration

## Root Cause Discovery (Day 3)
The mobile app was pointing to the wrong backend URL:
- **Incorrect**: `backend-michael-landesmans-projects.vercel.app` 
- **Correct**: `backend-liart-seven.vercel.app`

This was caused by Vercel environment variables overriding local .env files during deployment.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend URL Configuration
- Updated `.env.production` to point to correct backend
- Fixed Vercel environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
- Confirmed single production backend deployment

### 2. User Authentication Structure
- Fixed backend `/api/user/select-client` endpoint to check `req.user.samsProfile?.clientAccess`
- Reverted email-based authentication back to UID-based system
- Updated user document structure in Firestore

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- Fixed `RoleProtectedRoute.jsx` to check new `unitAssignments` structure
- Updated `MyUnitReport.jsx` to handle nested unit assignment data
- Corrected permission checking logic for unit owners/managers

### 4. Exchange Rates Feature
- Fixed API endpoint from `/api/clients/${clientId}/exchange-rates` to `/api/exchange-rates/check`
- Updated data structure handling (rates directly, not rates.rates)
- Removed Exchange Rates display card per user request
- Fixed currency conversion logic to handle MXN_[Currency] format

### 5. Cache Management
- Created emergency cache cleanup script for stubborn browser/CDN caches
- Addressed aggressive PWA service worker caching issues

## Deployment Configuration

### Frontend (Mobile App)
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Production URL**: https://mobile.sams.sandyland.com.mx
- **Deployment Method**: Manual via `npx vercel --prod`
- **Key Files**:
  - `.env.production` - Production environment variables
  - `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
  - `vite.config.js` - Build configuration with PWA settings

### Backend
- **Platform**: Firebase Functions
- **Production URL**: https://backend-liart-seven.vercel.app
- **Deployment Method**: Manual (NOT Git-linked)
- **Note**: Requires manual deployment of code changes

## Important Discoveries

1. **Vercel Environment Variables**: Override local .env files - must be updated in Vercel dashboard
2. **Data Structure Changes**: Frontend was expecting old structure while backend had new format
3. **Deployment Automation**: Currently being implemented by separate Implementation Agents (Phase 3)
4. **Manual Deployment Required**: Backend is not Git-linked, requires manual push

## Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ User authentication and login
- ✅ Client selection
- ✅ Unit Reports (for owners/managers)
- ✅ Exchange Rates Calculator
- ✅ Basic navigation and UI

### Known Issues for Future Work
- Math calculation issues in Unit Report (noted for change requests)
- Desktop UI needs verification (may have been affected by mobile fixes)
- Performance optimization needed (bundle size warnings)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify deployment URLs** in both local config and platform environment variables
2. **Check data structures** between frontend expectations and backend responses
3. **Browser caching** can mask fixes - need aggressive cache clearing strategies
4. **Document deployment processes** to avoid confusion about Git-linking and manual deployments
5. **Debug systematically** - add logging to understand exact failure points

## Next Steps

1. Verify desktop UI functionality hasn't been compromised
2. Continue with planned UI/UX improvements for mobile
3. Address performance warnings (code splitting for large bundles)
4. Complete deployment automation (in progress with Implementation Agents)
5. Create comprehensive testing suite for PWA features
