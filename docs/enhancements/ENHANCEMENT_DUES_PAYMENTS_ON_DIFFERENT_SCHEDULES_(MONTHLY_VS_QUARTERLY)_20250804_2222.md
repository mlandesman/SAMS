## User Story

The AVII client pays their HOA dues quarterly.  WWe are talkig about the minimum amount due.  Any owner can overpay or advance pay but each client will have a minimum payment period.  Most will be monthly (MTC) but some (AVII) have a required quarterly (3 months) payment.  The enhancement would work with the new Fiscal Year handling to determine HOA payment status and Past Due amounts for the dashboard and reports.  The data would still be stored and shown in monthly increaments but the logic and language would change for reports and  notifications to require full period (quarterly) payments.
