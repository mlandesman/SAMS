## User Story

The AVII (Aventuras Villas II) client has a unique situation with regard to water bills.  Each unit pays for their ownn water usage based on their own meter readings.  The water bill is very straightforward -- new meter reading minus previous meter reading times 50 pesos is the bill without taxes or other charges.  There is an extra component for washing cars (100 pesos per wash) and boats (200 pesos per wash).  We need a tool in SAMS to accept meter readings per unit, compare to previous meter readings, allow for car and boat washes then then generate a digitial request for payment to be emails to the unit's email addresses.  Payments will be tracked similar to HOA Dues with a grid of who has paid, who hasn't and the penalties of 5% per month after 10 days of non-paymment.  The payment will log as a transaction the same way HOA Dues payments are logged with cross-reference and notes.
