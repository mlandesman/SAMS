## User Story

Similar to Projects (not yet built) we need a system to track property Issues. It will be based on a traditional Trouble Ticket Management/Change Management System recording the incident, cause, impact, steps to resolution and end result.  It should track expenses.  It should connect to our Communications Module (not yet built) to update owners and bmanagement automatically and be available in both desktop and mobile apps.  Mobile only needs currently on-going incidents and recently closed incidents.  Tracking the date of the incident along with the expected life expectancy of the repair will help plan future budgets and work tasks.
