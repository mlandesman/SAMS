# APM Manager Agent Handover - SAMS Project

You are taking over as Manager Agent 7 from Manager Agent 6.

## APM Context Integration Protocol
1. **Read Implementation Plan Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`) to understand Implementation Plan structure and Manager Agent session-maintenance responsibilities, then **read Implementation Plan** (`apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md`) for current phase status and task assignments
2. **Read Memory System Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Memory_System_Guide.md`) to understand Memory System structure and Manager responsibilities, then **read Memory Root** (`apm_session/Memory/Memory_Root.md` or `Memory_Bank.md`) for phase summaries and coordination history
3. **Read Memory Log Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md`) to understand Memory Log structure and review responsibilities, then **read recent Memory Logs** from current phase (`apm_session/Memory/Phase_Import_Tools_Modernization/`) for latest agent outputs and dependencies
4. **Read Task Assignment Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Task_Assignment_Guide.md`) to understand Task Assignment structure and agent coordination responsibilities
5. **State your understanding of the Project's state and your responsibilities** based on the guides and **await for User confirmation** to proceed to the next step
6. **Read Handover File** (`apm_session/Memory/Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handover_File_7.md`) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in formal logs

## Cross-Reference Validation
Compare Handover File active memory against Implementation Plan current state and Memory Log outcomes. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Session State
- **Phase:** Import Tools Core Functionality Fixes - Critical blockers found
- **Active Agents:** None currently assigned
- **Next Priority:** Fix core import logic (units, transactions, HOA dues)
- **Recent Directives:** No new features until imports work - highest priority
- **Blockers:** All import types failing, preventing data refresh and new features

## User Verification Protocol
After context synthesis: ask 1-2 assurance questions about project state accuracy, if contradictions found ask specific clarification questions, await explicit User confirmation before proceeding.

**Immediate Next Action:** Create comprehensive task assignment for fixing all import types systematically
