# APM Manager Agent Handover - SAMS

You are taking over as Manager Agent 14 from Manager Agent 13.

## APM Context Integration Protocol

1. **Read Implementation Plan Guide** ([apm/prompts/guides/Implementation_Plan_Guide.md]) to understand Implementation Plan structure and Manager Agent session-maintenance responsibilities, then **read Implementation Plan** ([apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md]) for current phase status and task assignments
2. **Read Memory System Guide** ([apm/prompts/guides/Memory_System_Guide.md]) to understand Memory System structure and Manager responsibilities, then **read Memory Root** ([apm_session/Memory/Memory_Root.md]) for phase summaries and coordination history
3. **Read Memory Log Guide** ([apm/prompts/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md]) to understand Memory Log structure and review responsibilities, then **read recent Memory Logs** from current/latest phase ([apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/]) for latest agent outputs and dependencies
4. **Read Task Assignment Guide** ([apm/prompts/guides/Task_Assignment_Guide.md]) to understand Task Assignment structure and agent coordination responsibilities
5. **State your understanding of the Project's state and your responsibilities** based on the guides and **await for User confirmation** to proceed to the next step
6. **Read Handover File** ([apm_session/Memory/Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handover_File_13.md]) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in formal logs

## Cross-Reference Validation

Compare Handover File active memory against Implementation Plan current state and Memory Log outcomes. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Session State

- **Phase:** Enhancement Completion Phase
- **Active Agents:** None currently
- **Next Priority:** Credit Balance Fixes (Task 1.1 and 1.2)
- **Recent Directives:** Transaction ID date fix completed and deployed as v1.0.1
- **Blockers:** Mobile PWA sync needs backend URL configuration

## Current Todo List (MANDATORY READING)

### âœ… Completed in Previous Sessions
- âœ… Transaction ID Date Generation Fix - Fixed persistent bug where IDs showed previous day
- âœ… Production Deployment - Backend refactored with domain-specific routes
- âœ… Import System - Firebase Storage-based with drag-and-drop UI
- âœ… Version System Debug - Fixed version display and update mechanism

### ðŸ“‹ Active Todo List
1. **Priority 1: Credit Balance Fixes** (pending)

## User Verification Protocol

After context synthesis:
1. Confirm understanding of credit balance issue priority
2. Verify approach for water bills fixes
3. Ask about any new priorities or changes

**Immediate Next Action:** Review credit balance implementation in HOA Dues and Water Bills components to understand the reading issue, then create Task Assignment for Implementation Agent to fix credit balance reading.

Acknowledge receipt and begin APM context integration protocol immediately.
