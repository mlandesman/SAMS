   - Move credit balances from HOA Dues to new location
   - Verify data integrity

4. **Update HOA Dues Integration**
   - Update hoaDues controller to use new credit API
   - Remove credit balance logic from hoaDues collection
   - Test all HOA payment scenarios

5. **Update Water Bills Integration**
