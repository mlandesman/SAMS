## üéØ STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE

### PWA Strategy
**Decision:** Defer all PWA work until desktop/backend stabilized
**Rationale:** Avoid churn from ongoing API/endpoint changes; Water Bills reversion demonstrates risk
**Current Workaround:** Manual data entry costs only ~1 hour/month

### Statement of Account Strategy
**Decision:** Build Phase 1 with MTC simple data, enhance progressively
**Rationale:** Report serves as validation tool for data quality and system design
**Approach:** "Living document" that evolves as features complete

### Quarterly vs Penalties Sequence
**Decision:** Quarterly FIRST, then Penalties
**Rationale:** Need to understand quarterly challenges before designing penalty system
**Key Insight:** Quarterly = display logic, Penalties = calculation logic (monthly, regardless of display)

### Budget Module Timing
**Decision:** AFTER Statement of Account, BEFORE Monthly Reports
**Rationale:** Needed for Budget vs Actual reporting; simple implementation

### Deferred Issues
**Decision:** All Category A bugs DEFERRED (have workarounds)
**Exceptions:** Exchange Rates Dev (easy win, ~1 session)
