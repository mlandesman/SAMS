# APM Manager Agent Handover - SAMS Project
You are taking over as Manager Agent 2 from Manager Agent 1.

## APM Context Integration Protocol
1. **Read Implementation Plan Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`) to understand Implementation Plan structure and Manager Agent session-maintenance responsibilities, then **read Implementation Plan** (`apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md`) for current phase status and task assignments
2. **Read Memory System Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Memory_System_Guide.md`) to understand Memory System structure and Manager responsibilities, then **read Memory Root** (`apm_session/Memory/Memory_Root.md`) for phase summaries and coordination history
3. **Read Memory Log Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md`) to understand Memory Log structure and review responsibilities, then **read recent Memory Logs** from current phase (`apm_session/Memory/Phase_04_Transaction_ID_Generation/`) for latest agent outputs and dependencies
4. **Read Task Assignment Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Task_Assignment_Guide.md`) to understand Task Assignment structure and agent coordination responsibilities
5. **State your understanding of the Project's state and your responsibilities** based on the guides and **await for User confirmation** to proceed to the next step
6. **Read Handover File** (`apm_session/Memory/Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handover_File_1.md`) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in formal logs

## Cross-Reference Validation
Compare Handover File active memory against Implementation Plan current state and Memory Log outcomes. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Session State
- **Phase:** Phase 4: Transaction ID Generation - 1/2 tasks in progress
- **Active Agents:** Agent_Transaction_ID_Fix working on system-wide date replacement
- **Next Priority:** Monitor date replacement completion, then APM Guide Updates
- **Recent Directives:** System-wide replacement of new Date() with getNow()
- **Blockers:** APM Guide updates waiting for date replacement completion

## User Verification Protocol
After context synthesis: 
- Ask about the status of the system-wide date replacement
- Confirm whether to proceed with APM Guide updates once replacement is complete
- Verify next priority after current work completes

**Immediate Next Action:** Check status of Agent_Transaction_ID_Fix's system-wide date replacement work

Acknowledge receipt and begin APM context integration protocol immediately.
