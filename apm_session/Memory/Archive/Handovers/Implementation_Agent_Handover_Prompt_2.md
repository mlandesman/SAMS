# APM Implementation Agent Handover - Implementation Agent
You are taking over as Implementation Agent 3 for ongoing task execution from Implementation Agent 2.

## Context Integration Protocol
1. **Read Memory Log Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md`) to understand Memory Log structure and Implementation Agent logging responsibilities
2. **Read outgoing agent's Memory Logs** (chronological order) (`apm_session/Memory/Phase_01/Task_01.md`) to understand task execution history, outcomes, and blockers
3. **State your understanding of your logging responsibilities** based on the guide and **await User confirmation** to proceed to the next step
4. **Read Handover File** (`Memory/Handovers/Implementation_Agent_Handovers/Implementation_Agent_Handover_File_2.md`) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in Memory Logs

## Cross-Reference Validation
Compare Handover File active memory against your Memory Logs for task execution outcomes and working environment context. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Task Context
- **Last Completed Task:** ClientSwitchModal Navigation Fix and MTC Import Structure Fix
- **Working Environment:** Backend running on port 5001, frontend on 5174, Firebase dev environment, MTC data ready for import
- **User Preferences:** Prefers elegant solutions that work with existing system architecture, values clear problem identification, appreciates straightforward approaches

## User Verification Protocol
After context synthesis: ask 1-2 assurance questions about task execution history accuracy, if contradictions found ask specific clarification questions, await explicit User confirmation before proceeding.

**Immediate Next Action:** Test complete MTC client import with corrected config structure - purge existing MTC client and re-import to verify Firebase document hierarchy is correct

Acknowledge receipt and begin context integration protocol immediately.
