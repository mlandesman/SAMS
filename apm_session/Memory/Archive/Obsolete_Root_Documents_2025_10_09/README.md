# Archived Root Documents - October 9, 2025

**Archive Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Manager Agent:** Session document consolidation and synchronization

## Purpose

This archive contains root-level tracking documents that became obsolete as the project tracking system evolved to a hybrid GitHub Issues + PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md approach.

## Archived Documents

### TECHNICAL_DEBT.md
- **Last Updated:** January 19, 2025 (severely outdated)
- **Reason for Archive:** Content has been merged into PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md
- **Status:** All relevant technical debt items now tracked in PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md
- **Note:** Some items (TD-005, TD-006) were already resolved but never updated in this file

### Tasks Order.rtf
- **Created:** Early October 2025
- **Reason for Archive:** Linear task sequence has been mapped into Implementation_Plan.md priorities
- **Content:** Items 3-13 representing user's desired execution order
- **Status:** All tasks now properly structured in Implementation_Plan.md Priority 3 onwards
- **Note:** Items 1-2 were already completed and removed before archiving

## New Tracking System

**Current Structure (October 9, 2025 onwards):**

1. **Implementation_Plan.md** (`apm_session/`)
   - APM framework document
   - Detailed task specifications for Implementation Agents
   - Updated to reflect current project status and priorities

2. **PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md** (root)
   - Comprehensive tracking for enhancements, issues, and technical debt
   - Single source of truth for project status
   - Used in hybrid system with GitHub Issues

3. **GitHub Issues**
   - Active work items (current sprint/week)
   - Critical and high-priority bugs
   - Items requiring APM integration

4. **ISSUE_TRACKING_WORKFLOW.md**
   - Defines the hybrid tracking approach
   - Workflow for managing issues across systems

## Historical Context

These archived documents served important roles during project development but became redundant as:
- The APM framework matured
- The hybrid GitHub Issues approach was adopted
- Duplicate tracking across multiple files created maintenance burden
- PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md evolved to be the comprehensive source of truth
