# Task Log: Transaction Date Timezone Fix

## Summary
Fixed transaction date timezone issue where dates selected in UI were showing as previous day. Implemented working solution using existing timezone utilities, though proper Luxon infrastructure exists but is unused.

## Details
Investigated date handling across multiple components and identified root cause as JavaScript Date objects defaulting to UTC midnight when created from date strings. When these dates reach backend and convert to Cancun timezone (UTC-5), they shift back to previous day. Fixed by using `getMexicoDateTime()` utility which creates dates at noon to prevent timezone shifts.

## Output
- Modified files: 
  - frontend/sams-ui/src/layout/DuesPaymentModal.jsx (line 481)
  - frontend/sams-ui/src/layout/UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx (lines 131, 178, 211)
  - frontend/sams-ui/src/api/transaction.js (lines 36-40, 142-146)
- Fixed date handling to use getMexicoDateTime() function
- Dates now properly preserve selected value without timezone shift

## Issues
None - fix implemented successfully. However, technical debt identified: complete Luxon DateService exists in backend but is not being used.

## Important Findings
- Backend has complete Luxon-based DateService at backend/services/DateService.js
- Enhancement document shows proper implementation was planned but not completed
- Current fix works but bypasses the proper timezone infrastructure
- User noticed we're not using Luxon library that was installed for this purpose

## Next Steps
Consider refactoring to use proper Luxon DateService:
- Update backend controllers to import and use DateService
- Use dateService.parseFromFrontend() for incoming dates
- Standardize API responses with dateService.formatForFrontend()
- Remove dependency on basic timezone.js utilities
