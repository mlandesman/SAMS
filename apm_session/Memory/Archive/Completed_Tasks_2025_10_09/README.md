## Completion Summary

All three task assignments were part of the same fix completed September 25, 2025. Credit balance delete reversal was broken - when HOA payments were deleted, the credit balance history wasn't being properly updated, causing data corruption.

**Fix:** Credit history now stores amounts in centavos consistently instead of mixing pesos and centavos.

**Impact:** Credit balance now accurately tracks additions, usage, and reversals.
