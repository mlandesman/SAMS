# Outdated Root-Level Documents - October 9, 2025

**Archive Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Reason:** Documents outdated/superseded by October 9 Priority Workshop and document consolidation

## Purpose

This archive contains root-level documents that became outdated as the project evolved. All relevant information has been consolidated into current tracking documents.

## Current Documents (Active)

**Use these instead:**

1. **apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md** - THE definitive implementation plan
2. **PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md** - Comprehensive tracking
3. **apm_session/PRIORITY_WORKSHOP_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - October 9 workshop summary
4. **apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/** - Individual completion logs

## Why Archived?

### Problem Solved
All these documents were cluttering the root directory and could confuse new Implementation Agents about what's current vs historical.

### October 9 Priority Workshop
The comprehensive priority workshop consolidated all tracking into:
- Single Implementation_Plan.md (APM-compliant)
- Single PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md (comprehensive tracking)
- Clear Priority 1-15 roadmap
- GitHub Issues for active work

### Benefit
New agents now have clear, current documents without confusion from outdated handovers, old completion summaries, or superseded plans.
