# Manager Agent Handover File - SAMS Project

## Active Memory Context

### MANDATORY TODO LIST READING

#### Currently Active Tasks (IN PROGRESS)
- **CRITICAL: Fix Transaction ID Date Regression** - Status: IN_PROGRESS
  - Initial fix completed (IDs now show correct dates)
  - Agent continuing with system-wide replacement
- **System-Wide Date Replacement** - Status: IN_PROGRESS  
  - Replace all `new Date()` with `getNow()` for Cancun timezone consistency
  - Implementation Agent actively working on this

#### Pending High Priority Tasks
- **Priority 1: Credit Balance Fixes** - Fix HOA Dues and Water Bills payment components not reading credit balances properly + Add credit balance editing interface
- **Priority 2: Water Bills Fixes** - Fix consumption display, due date display, reading period, auto-advance features (5 specific issues)
- **Priority 3: HOA Dues Quarterly Collection Support** - Implement quarterly view logic based on config.feeStructure.duesFrequency
- **Update APM Guides** - Add getNow() usage requirements, ban new Date(), update review criteria (WAITING for global replacement completion)

#### Pending Medium Priority Tasks
- **Edit Transactions Enhancement** - Update edit function to handle ID-first structures and split allocations
- **Priority 4: HOA Dues Late Fee Penalties** - Apply Water Bills penalty logic to HOA Dues with quarterly adjustments
- **Priority 5: Water Bill Payment Request** - Automated email with consumption, past due, penalties, notes
- **Priority 6: Digital Receipts Production Integration** - Fine-tune and test receipt templates and sending process
- **Priority 7: Budget Module** - Create budget entry system for Report Generator Budget vs Actual analysis
- **Priority 8a: Statement of Account Report** - Critical report for unit owners and managers with bilingual support
- **TD-007: HOA Dues Unnecessary Split Allocations** - Optimize to only use splits for multi-period or credit scenarios

#### Pending Low Priority Tasks
- **Priority 8b: Other Reports** - Monthly transaction history, HOA dues update, special projects, budget vs actual reports
- **Priority 9: Propane Tanks Module** - Monthly readings for MTC client propane tanks (similar to Water Bills)
- **Priority 10: PWA/Mobile App for Maintenance Workers** - Integrate water meter readings and propane tank readings
- **Priority 11: PWA/Mobile Refactor** - Complete update to current standards after 2+ months of desktop development
- **Priority 12: PWA/Mobile Expense Entry and Payment Receipts** - Field payment and expense recording functionality
- **Priority 13: Export Functions** - CSV and Excel export capability for reports and queries

#### Completed Tasks (During This Session)
- **TD-005: HOA Dues Credit Balance Cascading Delete Fix** ✅
  - Fixed unit conversion issue (pesos vs centavos)
  - Credit balance now properly reverses when deleting transactions
  - Git commit: c151978
- **TD-006: HOA Dues Transaction Date Timezone Fix** ✅
  - Fixed daytime payments showing previous date
  - Implemented getMexicoDateTime() for proper timezone handling
- **APM Guide Updates** ✅
  - Updated Memory Log Guide, Implementation Agent, and Manager Agent prompts
  - Fixed Memory Log location and reporting requirements

### User Directives
- **Critical Directive**: System-wide replacement of `new Date()` with `getNow()` 
- Michael wants architectural solution to prevent future timezone issues
- Date pickers can process user input but defaults should use `getNow()`
- APM documentation needs updating after global replacement is complete

### Decisions
- Approved global date replacement strategy instead of spot fixes
- Will enforce `getNow()` usage through APM guides and code reviews
- Transaction ID fix led to discovery of broader architectural improvement

## Coordination Status

### Producer-Consumer Dependencies
- [Transaction ID Fix] → [Available for System-Wide Date Replacement]
- [System-Wide Date Replacement] → [Blocked: APM Guide Updates waiting for completion]
- [Credit Balance Fix] → [Completed, no dependencies]

### Coordination Insights
- Implementation Agent working efficiently on date replacement
- Previous fixes (TD-005, TD-006) completed faster than estimated
- Agent discovered and proposed architectural solution proactively

## Next Actions

### Ready Assignments
1. **Monitor System-Wide Date Replacement** - Agent_Transaction_ID_Fix is actively working
2. **Prepare APM Guide Updates** - Ready to implement once date replacement completes
3. **Priority 1: Credit Balance Fixes** - Next high priority after date work

### Blocked Items
- **APM Guide Updates** - Waiting for system-wide date replacement completion

### Phase Transition
- Currently in Phase 4: Transaction ID Generation
- May need new phase for Credit Balance UI work after current tasks

## Working Notes

### File Patterns
- Memory logs: `apm_session/Memory/Phase_XX_Name/Task_XX_Name.md`
- Task assignments: `apm_session/Task_Assignment_*.md`
- Implementation Plan: `apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md`

### Coordination Strategies
- Multi-step tasks work well for complex fixes
- Implementation Agents appreciate clear context from previous work
- Providing archived solutions helps agents avoid starting from scratch

### User Preferences
- Prefers architectural solutions over band-aids
- Values data integrity and proper timezone handling
- Appreciates when agents propose better approaches
- Quick to provide guidance when asked

### Current Active Files
- **Task Assignment**: `apm_session/Task_Assignment_Fix_Transaction_ID_Regression.md`
- **Memory Log**: `apm_session/Memory/Phase_04_Transaction_ID_Generation/Task_04_Fix_Transaction_ID_Date_Regression.md`
- **Implementation Agent Handover**: `Memory/Handovers/Implementation_Agent_Handovers/Implementation_Agent_Handover_File_12.md`

### Key Technical Context
- `getNow()` function created in `backend/services/DateService.js`
- Returns Cancun timezone (UTC-5) consistently
- Pattern: User dates preserved as-is, system timestamps use `getNow()`
- Luxon library properly integrated for date handling
