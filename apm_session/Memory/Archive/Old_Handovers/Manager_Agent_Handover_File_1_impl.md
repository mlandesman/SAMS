# Manager Agent Handover File - APM Manager Agent

## Mandatory Reading: Complete Todo List Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODOS:
1. **URGENT: Fix HOA Dues units context destructuring error - breaking HOA functionality** - COMPLETED
   - Root cause: useHOADues() returning undefined, HOADuesView not wrapped properly with provider
   - Solution: Added proper error handling to useHOADues hook, fixed React context access
   - Result: HOA Dues view accessible via /hoadues route through ActivityView

## Active Memory Context

**User Preferences:** 
- Follows David Allen GTD methodology (Value vs. Urgency prioritization)
- Prefers surgical, targeted fixes over broad code changes
- Emphasizes no legacy fallbacks, clean implementation
- Values systematic OCD-friendly development approach
- Requires explicit testing and verification before claiming completion

**Working Insights:**
- AVII client needs are driving urgent priorities (Google Sheets limitations)
- Credit balance system is foundational for payment processing
- Frontend context providers must be properly wrapped in routing
- Units data structure uses `unitId` and `owners` array, not `id` and `owner`
- Backend authentication middleware critical for API route security

## Task Execution Context

**Working Environment:**
- Backend server: http://localhost:5001/
- Frontend server: http://localhost:5173/
- Key directories: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/`, `/backend/`
- Authentication: Firebase tokens required for all API calls
- Context providers: Must be wrapped correctly in ActivityView routing

**Issues Identified:**
- ‚úÖ RESOLVED: HOA Dues context destructuring error blocking all HOA functionality
- ‚úÖ RESOLVED: DuesPaymentModal showing "undefined ()" in unit dropdown
- ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Credit balance editing authentication 401 errors
- ‚úÖ RESOLVED: Water Bills year logic using 2025 instead of fiscal year 2026
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ONGOING: Need to restore direct unit selection when clicking table cells

## Current Context

**Recent User Directives:**
- Reprioritized from original plan due to critical HOA Dues breaking issue
- Emphasized repairing damaged code before moving to Priority 2 Water Bills fixes
- Requested surgical fixes maintaining existing working patterns
- Preferred stashing working code as backup before further changes

**Working State:**
- Code stashed with git: "Working credit balance fixes - dropdown units showing correctly"
- Servers running and ready for testing
- HOA Dues view functional at /hoadues route
- Credit balance editing working with proper authentication

**Task Execution Insights:**
- Always verify working patterns before changing code structure
- Use utility functions pattern (`getOwnerInfo`) instead of direct property access
- Context provider wrapping is critical for React hook functionality
- Git stashing essential when making incremental fixes

## Working Notes

**Development Patterns:**
- Use `unitId || id` pattern for consistent unit identification
- Follow existing `unitUtils.js` patterns for owner name extraction
- Implement authentication middleware at route level, not individual endpoints
- Use HOADuesProvider wrapper only in ActivityView routing

**Environment Setup:**
- Backend routes: `/hoadues/:clientId/credit/:unitId/:year` for credit balance updates
- Frontend contexts: HOADuesContext with useHOADues hook
- File paths: `src/components/DuesPaymentModal.jsx`, `src/views/HOADuesView.jsx`
- Authentication: `authenticateUserWithProfile` middleware required

**User Interaction:**
- Prefers demonstration of issues via screenshots
- Values backend log analysis for debugging
- Expects verification through actual testing, not theoretical success
- Appreciates systematic approach with clear success criteria
- Responds well to GTD-style Value/Urgency framework analysis

## Current Task Status

**Last Completed:** Priority 1 Credit Balance Fixes
- ‚úÖ Water Bills fiscal year logic fixed (2025 ‚Üí 2026)
- ‚úÖ HOA Dues context destructuring error resolved
- ‚úÖ DuesPaymentModal unit dropdown showing proper names
- ‚úÖ Credit balance editing with full authentication and audit trail
- üîÑ IN PROGRESS: Restoring direct unit selection from table cell clicks

**Next Expected Task:** Continue Priority 1 completion or move to Priority 2 Water Bills Fixes per Implementation Plan priority order.

**Blocker Status:** None. System functional, minor UX improvement pending (direct cell selection).
