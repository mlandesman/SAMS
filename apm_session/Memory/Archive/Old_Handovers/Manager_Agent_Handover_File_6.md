# Manager Agent Handover File - SAMS Project

## Current Todo List
1. **Create task assignment for web-based import/purge UI system** - COMPLETE (Task_Assignment_Web_Based_Import_System.md created)
2. **Prepare task assignment for Priority 3: HOA Dues Quarterly Collection Support** - PENDING (HIGH)
3. **Create task for Credit Balance revert/delete feature - add UI option in Edit modal or Context Menu** - PENDING (LOW)
4. **Prepare task for Edit Transactions Enhancement - handle ID-first structures and split allocations** - PENDING (LOW)
5. **Update APM archival process documentation to include new policy about moving confusing files** - PENDING (LOW)

## Prior Completed Todos from Previous Managers
1. **Create APM Guide for date handling best practices in SAMS** - COMPLETED by Manager_1
2. **Update existing APM guides to reference Date Handling Guide** - COMPLETED by Manager_3 (consolidated into CRITICAL_CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
3. **Update Task Assignment Guide to include date handling verification** - COMPLETED by Manager_3
4. **Update Implementation Agent guides to reference Date Handling Guide** - COMPLETED by Manager_3
5. **Review and approve TD-005 Credit Balance Fix** - COMPLETED by Manager_2
6. **Review and approve TD-006 Transaction Date Fix** - COMPLETED by Manager_3
7. **Create task assignment for Credit Balance Edit Notes fix** - COMPLETED by Manager_3 (Michael handled manually)
8. **Archive completed work to prevent agent confusion** - COMPLETED by Manager_3
9. **Monitor and support Water Bills Fixes implementation** - COMPLETED by Manager_5
10. **Review Water Bills Table Formatting ad-hoc enhancement** - COMPLETED by Manager_5
11. **Create phased task assignment for import tools modernization** - COMPLETED by Manager_5

## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:** 
- Focus on doing import tools update right, not rushing AVII production
- Legacy scripts have good business logic but need DateService integration
- Web-based UI preferred over CLI for import/purge with checkbox selection
- Test with MTC first as it's more stable than AVII
- Users and client config should NOT be purged/reimported yet

**Decisions:** 
- Shifted from modernizing scripts to updating legacy scripts with DateService
- Discovered mock object serialization issue preventing controller usage
- Pivoted to web-based import system to avoid mock objects entirely
- Created comprehensive 4-phase web UI task assignment

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- Import script analysis COMPLETE → Web-based system design READY
- Legacy scripts identified → DateService integration BLOCKED by architecture issue
- Mock object problem discovered → Web UI solution proposed

**Coordination Insights:** 
- Implementation Agents need clear architecture guidance to avoid mock object issues
- Legacy scripts contain valuable business logic worth preserving
- Web-based approach solves multiple problems (auth, audit, UI, no mocks)
- Michael prefers visual interfaces with checkboxes over CLI commands

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:** 
- Task_Assignment_Web_Based_Import_System.md ready for Implementation Agent
- Priority 3: HOA Dues Quarterly Collection task needs creation

**Blocked Items:** 
- Legacy script DateService integration blocked by mock object architecture issue
- AVII production import waiting for working import system

**Phase Transition:** 
- Import tools modernization pivoting from CLI to web-based approach
- Next priority after web import system: HOA Quarterly Collection support

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:** 
- Task assignments: apm_session/Task_Assignment_*.md
- Import scripts: /scripts/client-onboarding/
- Enhanced scripts: /scripts/client-onboarding/*-enhanced.js
- Legacy scripts: /scripts/client-onboarding/*.js.backup
- Data files: /MTCdata/*.json and /AVIIdata/*.json

**Coordination Strategies:** 
- When hitting architecture issues, consider alternative approaches
- Present UI-based solutions when appropriate for Michael's preferences
- Test with stable data (MTC) before production data (AVII)
- Preserve working business logic when modernizing

**User Preferences:** 
- Prefers doing things right over rushing
- Likes visual UI with checkboxes for selection
- Values proven business logic from legacy code
- Wants selective control over what to purge/import
- Concerned about data integrity and proper date handling

## Technical Context
**Import System Status:**
- Legacy scripts work but lack DateService (timezone sliding risk)
- Modern scripts have correct architecture but mock object serialization fails
- Web-based approach eliminates mock objects by using real API calls
- Critical need: prevent date sliding with proper timezone handling

**Current Issues:**
- Mock req/res objects contain functions that can't serialize to Firestore
- Controllers expect Express request/response objects
- Import scripts run from CLI without web server context
- Solution: Use actual web server with real authentication

**Active Task Assignments:**
- Task_Assignment_Import_Tools_Modernization.md - PARTIALLY COMPLETE (blocked by mock issue)
- Task_Assignment_Legacy_Scripts_DateService_Update.md - CREATED but blocked
- Task_Assignment_Web_Based_Import_System.md - NEW, ready for implementation
