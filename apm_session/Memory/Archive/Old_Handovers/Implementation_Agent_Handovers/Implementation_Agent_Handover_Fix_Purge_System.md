# Implementation Agent Handover - Fix Purge System

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Agent Type:** Implementation Agent  
**Task:** Fix Purge System for Ghost Documents and Proper Deletion  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocking Data Refresh  

---

## Task Assignment Location
**File:** `/apm_session/Task_Assignment_Fix_Purge_System_Ghost_Documents.md`

## Current Status
- Purge system is failing to delete HOA Dues and Units documents
- Ghost documents (with sub-collections but no top-level fields) not handled
- Firebase Console shows documents remain after purge operations
- Blocking all data refresh operations

## Key Issues to Fix
1. **HOA Dues Purge Failure** - Documents remain in Firebase Console after purge
2. **Units Purge Failure** - Documents remain in Firebase Console after purge  
3. **Ghost Document Problem** - Documents with sub-collections but no top-level fields
4. **Incomplete Deletion Logic** - Not handling nested document structures properly

## Critical Requirements
- Must completely delete HOA Dues and Units from Firebase Console
- Must handle ghost documents (documents with only sub-collections)
- Must delete all sub-collections recursively
- Must provide accurate progress reporting
- Must handle errors gracefully

## Files to Modify
- `/backend/controllers/importController.js` - Main purge logic
- `/backend/services/importService.js` - Component-specific purge methods

## Testing Requirements
1. **Dry Run Testing** - Test with `dryRun: true` first
2. **Actual Purge Testing** - Test with real MTC data
3. **Firebase Console Verification** - Confirm complete deletion
4. **Error Handling Testing** - Test with various failure scenarios

## Success Criteria
- HOA Dues documents completely deleted from Firebase Console
- Units documents completely deleted from Firebase Console
- Ghost documents properly detected and deleted
- Sub-collections completely removed
- No orphaned documents or collections remain

## Next Steps After Completion
1. Create completion log in `/apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/`
2. Test the fixed purge system with MTC data
3. Proceed to fix import processing order
4. Execute complete data refresh cycle

## Dependencies
- This task must be completed before any import operations
- Blocking the complete MTC data refresh
- Required for all future development work

**Instructions:** Read the full task assignment file and implement the comprehensive purge system fixes as specified. Focus on recursive sub-collection deletion and ghost document handling.
