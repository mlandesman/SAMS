## Original Task Assignment

**File**: `/Memory/Task_Assignments/Task_Assignment_Fix_Water_Bills_Dashboard_Data_Structure.md`

**Task**: Fix Water Bills Dashboard Data Structure Mismatch
- **Priority**: HIGH - CRITICAL  
- **Issue**: Dashboard receives water bills data but can't process it (structure mismatch)
- **Evidence**: Backend logs show rich data, but no dashboard cache/display
- **Root Cause**: Recent water bills updates changed data format, dashboard expectations outdated

**Key Investigation Required**:
1. Compare: useDashboardData.js vs working WaterBillsContext.jsx
2. Data Format: Dashboard expects old structure, API returns new aggregated format
3. Fix: Update dashboard to process current API response format
4. Result: Dashboard water bills card shows actual past due amounts

## Active Memory Context

**User Preferences**: 
- Michael prefers to understand the root cause before implementing fixes
- Wants centralized, reusable solutions instead of multiple modules doing things their own way
- Values proper Firestore-based configuration over hardcoded client IDs
- Requires live testing with real data, not just code review

**Working Insights**: 
- SAMS uses a pattern where sidebar menu is built from Firestore `/clients/:clientId/config/activities` 
- Water bills detection should be based on `activity: "WaterBills"` in the activities array
- Dashboard and components were using inconsistent methods to detect water bills feature
- Timing issues exist between menu loading from Firestore and dashboard initialization

## Task Execution Context

**Working Environment**: 
- Frontend React app in `/frontend/sams-ui/src/`
- Key files: `hooks/useDashboardData.js`, `views/DashboardView.jsx`, `context/ClientContext.jsx`
- New utility: `/utils/clientFeatures.js` for centralized feature detection
- Water Bills Context: `/context/WaterBillsContext.jsx` (working reference implementation)
- Water API Service: `/api/waterMeterService.js`

**Issues Identified**:
- **RESOLVED**: Dashboard was using direct API calls instead of WaterBillsContext pattern
- **RESOLVED**: Hardcoded client detection (`selectedClient?.id === 'AVII'`) instead of Firestore-based
- **RESOLVED**: Menu timing issue - dashboard ran before menuConfig loaded from Firestore
- **ACTIVE**: Cache write/read mismatch - water bills cache is written but not read

## Current Context

**Recent User Directives**:
- "Remove hardcoded client ID checks - use Firestore configuration"
- "Create centralized utility function for water bills detection"
- "Base detection on activity array activity:WaterBills"
- "Cache is being written but not read - causing repeated API calls"

**Working State**:
- Dashboard now shows correct water bills data ($2,625 instead of $0)
- Water bills card appears/disappears correctly based on client configuration
- All components use centralized `hasWaterBills()` function
- Console logs show cache being written multiple times but never read

**Task Execution Insights**:
- WaterBillsContext.jsx uses the correct API service and data processing pattern
- Menu loading from Firestore has timing implications for dashboard initialization
- Cache utility functions are shared but may have key mismatch issues
- Console debugging is essential for understanding async loading sequences

## Working Notes

**Development Patterns**:
- Use WaterBillsContext pattern for water bills data fetching
- Import menuConfig from ClientContext for feature detection
- Add dependency arrays including isLoadingMenu and menuConfig for timing
- Prefix console logs with component identifier (üíß Dashboard:, üîç [clientFeatures])

**Environment Setup**:
- Water bills cache key pattern: `water_bills_${clientId}_${year}`
- Cache utility functions in useDashboardData.js: `getFromCache()`, `saveToCache()`
- AVII client has water bills enabled in Firestore activities array
- Backend API endpoint: `/water/clients/${clientId}/data/${year}`

**User Interaction**:
- Michael uses browser dev tools to verify cache entries and console logs
- Prefers seeing exact data structures and API responses in console
- Wants to see cache hit/miss logs to understand cache behavior
- Values step-by-step debugging approach to isolate issues

## Outstanding Cache Issue Analysis

**Problem**: Water bills cache is being written repeatedly but never read, causing unnecessary API calls.

**Evidence from Console Logs**:
```
‚úÖ Dashboard saved to cache: water_bills_AVII_2026 (multiple times)
‚ùå No "Dashboard cache hit for key:" messages
‚ùå Repeated API fetch cycles instead of cache usage
```

**Likely Causes**:
1. **Cache key mismatch** - Different keys for save vs. retrieve operations
2. **Cache timing issue** - Cache cleared between save and read operations  
3. **Cache storage issue** - SessionStorage problems with data format/size

**Next Steps to Investigate**:
1. Add detailed logging to cache get/set operations with exact keys
2. Compare cache keys being used for write vs. read operations
3. Check sessionStorage directly in browser dev tools for cache entries
4. Verify cache timestamp and duration logic
5. Test cache retrieval immediately after save operation

**Files to Examine**:
- `/frontend/sams-ui/src/hooks/useDashboardData.js` (cache logic lines 14-47)
- Cache key generation: `getWaterCacheKey(clientId, year)` 
- Cache operations: `getFromCache(key)` and `saveToCache(key, data)`

The main task is 95% complete - dashboard shows real water bills data. The cache optimization is a performance issue that needs investigation.
