### Current Issue Being Worked On
- [ ] **Fix file deletion logic** - Files should remain after import, only deleted when starting NEW import with NEW files
- [ ] **Test complete import flow with proper file management** - Verify files persist after import and clean up correctly

## Active Memory Context

**User Preferences:** 
- Zero tolerance for technical debt - requires production app standards
- Prefers simple solutions over complex ones
- Never modify core system functions (like createTransaction) for edge cases
- Always use timezone-aware date handling (no `new Date()` due to UTC â†’ America/Cancun conversion issues)
- Collaborative approach - challenge and question suboptimal requests
- Never claim success without documented testing results
- Always verify component usage against ACTIVE_MODULES.md
- Never use code from `_archive` directories
- **NEW**: Files should remain after import and only be deleted when starting NEW import with NEW files

**Working Insights:** 
- Firebase Storage vs filesystem reads can cause data format differences (ISO vs legacy dates)
- CSS grid/flexbox issues often require inline styles for reliability
- Simple parameter passing (clientId) is better than complex dynamic discovery
- Date parsing requires format detection (ISO vs M/d/yyyy) rather than forcing single format
- Core system functions should never be modified for specific use cases
- Always test UI changes in actual browser environment
- **NEW**: Backend should not delete files during import process - files are managed by frontend upload process
- **NEW**: File naming case sensitivity matters (config.json vs Config.json)

## Task Execution Context

**Working Environment:** 
- Project: SAMS (Sandyland Asset Management System)
- Firebase project: sandyland-management-system (Dev environment)
- Frontend: React/Vite app in `frontend/sams-ui/`
- Backend: Node.js in `backend/` with Firebase Functions
- Key directories: `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/`, `backend/services/`, `backend/controllers/`
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend/backend) + Firebase (functions/storage/hosting)

**Issues Identified:** 
- **RESOLVED**: Firebase Storage permissions - fixed with proper security rules
- **RESOLVED**: Date parsing errors - ISO format dates from Firebase Storage vs legacy M/d/yyyy from filesystem
- **RESOLVED**: Double-parsing issue - createTransaction was trying to parse already-parsed Firestore timestamps
- **RESOLVED**: Missing clientId in import requests - fixed parameter passing
- **RESOLVED**: UI layout issues - CSS grid not working, switched to flexbox with inline styles
- **RESOLVED**: getImportConfig hardcoded to local filesystem path - changed to 'firebase_storage'
- **RESOLVED**: Frontend dataPath logic - now uses 'firebase_storage' for onboarding
- **RESOLVED**: getImportDataCounts filesystem operations - now uses ImportService for Firebase Storage
- **RESOLVED**: Progress tracking broken - restored with proper Firebase Storage support
- **RESOLVED**: Backend deleting files during import - removed deleteImportFiles call from executeImport
- **CURRENT**: File deletion logic needs refinement - files should persist after import

## Current Context

**Recent User Directives:** 
- Files should remain after import and only be deleted when starting NEW import with NEW files
- The current approach of deleting files during import process is wrong
- Need to implement proper file lifecycle management

**Working State:** 
- All code committed and pushed to GitHub
- Frontend: https://sams-frontend-plxs3ldbk-michael-landesmans-projects.vercel.app
- Backend: https://backend-adrkb60pl-michael-landesmans-projects.vercel.app
- Firebase: https://sandyland-management-system.web.app
- All Firebase services deployed (functions, storage rules, hosting)
- Import process works but file management needs refinement

**Task Execution Insights:** 
- Always use inline styles for CSS layout issues to ensure reliability
- Test date parsing with actual data formats from different sources
- Implement format detection rather than forcing single format
- Use timezone-aware date handling with DateService, never `new Date()`
- Prefer parameter passing over dynamic discovery for simplicity
- **NEW**: File upload and import are separate processes - files should persist between them
- **NEW**: File cleanup should only happen when explicitly starting a new import process

## Working Notes

**Development Patterns:** 
- Use inline styles for critical CSS layout to ensure browser compatibility
- Always test date parsing with actual data formats from different sources
- Implement format detection rather than forcing single format
- Use timezone-aware date handling with DateService, never `new Date()`
- Prefer parameter passing over dynamic discovery for simplicity
- **NEW**: Separate file upload from file deletion - they are independent operations

**Environment Setup:** 
- Frontend dev server: `npm run dev` (port 5173)
- Backend dev server: `npm run dev` 
- Firebase CLI: `firebase deploy --only [service]`
- Vercel CLI: `vercel --prod` for production deployment
- Key config files: `firebase.json`, `vercel.json`, `storage.rules`

**User Interaction:** 
- Always explain reasoning behind technical decisions
- Challenge suboptimal approaches and suggest better alternatives
- Provide comprehensive commit messages with detailed descriptions
- Test thoroughly before claiming success
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- **NEW**: Understand that file lifecycle management is critical for user experience

## Complete Task Assignment

**Task**: Import File Upload Implementation

**Original Request**: Replace client onboarding directory path input with a file upload interface that uploads JSON files to Firebase Storage, maintaining the same user experience and import logic.

**Key Requirements**:
1. Import File Upload functionality - Upload JSON files directly to Firebase Storage
2. Client onboarding flow - Complete end-to-end import process from file upload to database
3. Firebase Storage integration - Full CRUD operations with proper security rules
4. UI improvements - Clean side-by-side layout, removed obsolete configuration box
5. Backend compatibility - Maintains existing import system while adding new capabilities
6. **NEW**: Proper file lifecycle management - files persist after import, only deleted for new imports

**Implementation Approach**:
- Changed data source from filesystem to Firebase Storage while preserving existing import flow
- Added ImportFileUploader component with drag-and-drop JSON file validation
- Enhanced ClientSwitchModal with file upload and client preview capabilities
- Updated SettingsView to auto-navigate to Data Management section during onboarding
- Fixed date parsing to handle both ISO and legacy formats seamlessly
- **NEW**: Implement proper file persistence and cleanup logic

## Current Status

**Task Status**: ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS - File Management Refinement Needed**

**Completed deliverables**:
- âœ… Import File Upload functionality
- âœ… Firebase Storage integration with proper security rules
- âœ… Enhanced UI with side-by-side Purge/Import layout
- âœ… Complete client onboarding flow
- âœ… Backend compatibility maintained
- âœ… All code deployed to production
- âœ… Progress tracking improvements
- âœ… File path and naming issues resolved

**Current Issue**: 
The file deletion logic needs to be refined. Currently, files are being deleted at the wrong time. The correct approach should be:
1. **Upload files** â†’ Files stored in Firebase Storage
2. **Import process** â†’ Files remain in Firebase Storage during and after import
3. **New import with new files** â†’ Only then should old files be deleted and new files uploaded

**Next Steps**: 
1. Review the file deletion logic in the frontend upload process
2. Ensure files persist after successful import
3. Only delete files when explicitly starting a new import with new files
4. Test the complete file lifecycle management

**Ready for**: File lifecycle management refinement and testing
