# Implementation Agent Handover File - Credit Balance Fix & Transaction Date Issue

## MANDATORY TODO LIST READING

### Current Todo List (COMPLETE)
1. ‚úÖ **Credit Balance Fix - Add comprehensive backend console logging** (COMPLETED)
2. ‚úÖ **Credit Balance Fix - Analyze backend logs to identify root cause** (COMPLETED)
3. ‚úÖ **Credit Balance Fix - Fix credit history to store amounts in centavos** (COMPLETED)
4. ‚úÖ **Credit Balance Fix - Test credit balance reversal** (COMPLETED)
5. üîÑ **Transaction Date Fix - Investigate frontend date handling in DuesPaymentModal** (IN PROGRESS)
6. ‚è≥ **Transaction Date Fix - Check how payment date is sent from frontend to backend** (PENDING)
7. ‚è≥ **Transaction Date Fix - Fix transaction date showing previous day** (PENDING)
8. ‚è≥ **Transaction Date Fix - Test date handling with Mexico timezone** (PENDING)

## Active Memory Context

### User Preferences
- Prefers comprehensive fixes at the data source rather than workarounds
- Wants proper timezone handling using existing SAMS utilities
- Emphasizes data consistency and integrity
- Values thorough testing with real data

### Working Insights
- **Credit Balance Storage**: All amounts must be stored in centavos throughout the system
- **API Layer Conversion**: Convert centavos to dollars/pesos only at the API response layer
- **Timezone Utilities**: The purpose-built timezone.js utilities are working correctly and should not be modified
- **Date Issue Location**: The transaction date issue is likely in the frontend or the API endpoint, not in timezone.js

## Task Execution Context

### Original Task Assignment
**File**: `/Memory/Task_Assignments/Active/Implementation_Agent_Credit_Balance_Fix.md`

**Objective**: Fix the broken credit balance delete reversal functionality identified through live testing.

**Key Requirements**:
1. Identify why credit balance cleanup logic isn't executing
2. Restore proper credit balance reversal on transaction deletion
3. Test with real data and verify functionality

### Completed Work

#### Credit Balance Fix (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
1. **Root Cause Identified**: Unit conversion mismatch - credit history stored amounts in pesos while credit balance was in centavos
2. **Solution Implemented**: 
   - Fixed all credit history entry creation to store amounts in centavos
   - Updated API responses to convert centavos to dollars/pesos for display
   - Fixed timestamp formatting for credit history display
3. **Testing Verified**: Created payment with $500 overpayment, deleted transaction, confirmed credit balance decreased correctly
4. **Code Changes**:
   - `backend/controllers/hoaDuesController.js` - Fixed credit history creation
   - `backend/controllers/transactionsController.js` - Added comprehensive logging
5. **Git Status**: Committed (c151978), merged to main, branch deleted

### Current Work - Transaction Date Issue

#### Problem Description
- Transactions created at 8:20 AM on September 25, 2025 show date as September 24, 2025
- This is a timezone conversion issue where dates are being shifted back

#### Investigation So Far
1. **Checked timezone.js**: Confirmed working correctly, reverted attempted changes
2. **Current Branch**: `fix-transaction-date-timezone`
3. **Next Steps**: Need to investigate frontend date handling in DuesPaymentModal

#### What I've Learned
- The backend timezone.js utilities create dates at midnight (00:00:00) which is correct
- The issue appears when a date string is processed, suggesting the problem is in how the frontend sends the date
- Creating dates at noon (12:00:00) helps avoid timezone boundary issues

### Working Environment
- **Key Files**:
  - `backend/utils/timezone.js` - DO NOT MODIFY (working correctly)
  - `backend/controllers/hoaDuesController.js` - Contains date processing logic
  - `frontend/sams-ui/src/layout/DuesPaymentModal.jsx` - Likely source of date issue
  - `frontend/sams-ui/src/utils/dateUtils.js` - Frontend date utilities

### Issues Identified
1. **Resolved**: Credit balance delete reversal not working
2. **Active**: Transaction dates showing previous day due to timezone handling

## Current Context

### Recent User Directives
- Revert timezone.js changes as it was purpose-built and working
- Look at frontend or endpoint for the date issue
- Commit credit balance fix before investigating date issue further

### Working State
- Current branch: `fix-transaction-date-timezone`
- Credit balance fix completed and merged
- Ready to investigate frontend date handling

### Task Execution Insights
- Always verify data consistency at creation point, not just usage point
- When dealing with timezone issues, check where dates are created and transmitted
- The SAMS system has specific timezone utilities that should be used consistently

## Working Notes

### Development Patterns
- Use `dollarsToCents()` and `centsToDollars()` for all currency conversions
- Store all amounts in centavos in the database
- Convert to display units only at the API response layer
- Use existing SAMS timezone utilities, don't create new ones

### Environment Setup
- Backend console logging is enhanced for debugging
- Test with real client data (MTC client, Unit PH4D)
- Verify dates in Mexico timezone (America/Cancun, UTC-5)

### User Interaction
- Michael prefers direct solutions over workarounds
- He values understanding the root cause before implementing fixes
- Quick to provide guidance when implementation approach is unclear

## Next Steps for Incoming Agent

1. **Investigate Frontend Date Handling**:
   - Check `frontend/sams-ui/src/layout/DuesPaymentModal.jsx`
   - Look for where `paymentDate` is set or sent to backend
   - Check if date is being converted to UTC before sending

2. **Trace Date Flow**:
   - Frontend: How is the date picked/set?
   - API Call: What format is the date sent in?
   - Backend: How does hoaDuesController.js receive and process it?

3. **Potential Solutions**:
   - Ensure frontend sends date string in YYYY-MM-DD format without time
   - Or ensure proper timezone handling if sending full datetime
   - Use existing SAMS date utilities consistently

4. **Testing Approach**:
   - Create transaction at different times of day
   - Verify the date appears correctly
   - Check both display and stored values
