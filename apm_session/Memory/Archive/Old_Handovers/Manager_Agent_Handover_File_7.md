## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:** 
- Import core functionality has many errors and needs fixing before any new features
- Web UI is complete but underlying import logic is broken
- This is highest priority - no new features until imports work
- Original working scripts were lost/broken during rebuilding

**Decisions:** 
- Pivoted from script modernization to web-based UI approach
- Fixed year-end balance structure issue (accounts array at root)
- Discovered core import logic has multiple failures beyond UI
- Must fix all import types before proceeding with features

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- Web UI COMPLETE → Core import fixes REQUIRED
- Import fixes BLOCKING → HOA Quarterly Collection feature
- Import fixes BLOCKING → All new feature development
- Import fixes BLOCKING → Production data refresh

**Coordination Insights:** 
- Implementation Agent successfully built web UI but core imports broken
- Units import failing due to null/undefined unitId in augmentation
- HOA import needs CrossRef file that doesn't exist
- Transaction import status unknown but likely has issues

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:** 
- Create comprehensive task assignment for fixing all import types
- Debug units import to find why unitId is null
- Test transaction import to identify issues
- Create CrossRef generator or modify HOA import

**Blocked Items:** 
- Priority 3: HOA Dues Quarterly Collection (waiting for imports)
- All new feature development (waiting for data refresh)
- Edit Transactions Enhancement (lower priority)

**Phase Transition:** 
- From web UI implementation to core import debugging
- Need systematic fix of each import type
- Consider breaking into multiple focused tasks

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:** 
- Task assignments: /apm_session/Task_Assignment_*.md
- Import service: /backend/services/importService.js
- Controllers: /backend/controllers/*Controller.js
- Data augmentation: /scripts/data-augmentation-utils.js
- Source data: /MTCdata/*.json and /AVIIdata/*.json

**Error Details:**
- Units: `Value for argument "documentPath" is not a valid resource path` at unitsController.js:54
- HOA: `ENOENT: no such file or directory... HOA_Transaction_CrossRef.json`
- Transactions: No visible errors but needs verification

**Coordination Strategies:** 
- Fix imports one type at a time in isolation
- Create test harness for each import type
- Document exact data structure requirements
- Preserve working import logic once fixed

**User Preferences:** 
- Wants reliable imports before new features
- Frustrated by regression of previously working functionality
- Values data integrity and system stability
- Needs ability to refresh data reliably

## Technical Context
**Import System Status:**
- Web UI complete with real-time progress tracking
- Backend infrastructure in place but logic flawed
- Data augmentation functions not providing required fields
- Missing dependencies like CrossRef file

**Current Issues:**
1. Units: augmentMTCUnit not setting unitId/unitNumber
2. Transactions: Unknown - needs diagnostic testing
3. HOA: Missing CrossRef file for payment linking
4. Categories/Vendors: Untested but likely have issues

**Architecture:**
```
Web UI → ImportController → ImportService → Augmentation → Controllers → Firestore
         ↓                                    ↓
   Progress Updates                    Data Transformation
```

**Active Task Assignments:**
- Task_Assignment_Web_Based_Import_System.md - UI COMPLETE
- Task_Assignment_Fix_Import_Data_Structure.md - COMPLETE
- Next: Need comprehensive import fixes task assignment

## Critical Information for Next Manager
1. **DO NOT** proceed with new features until imports work
2. **FOCUS** on fixing core import logic systematically
3. **TEST** each import type in isolation first
4. **DOCUMENT** working data structures for each type
5. **VERIFY** imported data works in application

The web UI is done but useless without working imports. This is the highest priority blocker.
