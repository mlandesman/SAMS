# Manager Agent Handover File 2 - SAMS Communications Enhancement

## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:** 
- Complete Water Bills to production standard before moving to other templates
- Focus on MVP features for go-live capability  
- Prioritize completing design requirements that were agreed upon but missed during technical fixes
- Need save functionality for template review and comparison to original design document
- Add missing features: bank info buttons, consumption comparison, account status links
- Replace static demo data with live Firebase MCP data integration

**Decisions:** 
- Domain-specific `/comm/email/` API architecture chosen over resource-based routes
- Template variable format standardized (avoid mixing `{{Variable}}` and `__Variable__` formats)
- MCP-enhanced development workflow proven successful with Firebase integration
- User prefers simple, maintainable solutions over complex architectures
- Firebase MCP confirmed working with real AVII data structure at `clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/2026-00`

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- Water Bills template variable processing → ✅ Fixed and working (completed by previous IA)
- Original design features → ❌ Missing bank info buttons, consumption comparison, account statement links, high usage warnings
- Static demo data → ❌ Needs replacement with live Firebase MCP data integration  
- Email sending functionality → ⚠️ Backend working but needs end-to-end testing with real email delivery
- Communication logging system → ⏳ Planned but not yet implemented for go-live
- Unit report integration → ⏳ Required for go-live but not started
- Trigger system → ⏳ Payment completion triggers and manual send buttons needed

**Coordination Insights:** 
- Implementation Agents work effectively when given specific technical fixes rather than broad architectural tasks
- Firebase MCP integration provides excellent real-data development capabilities (36 tools confirmed working)
- Template processing issues resolved quickly once format mismatch identified
- User values completing features fully rather than partial implementations across multiple areas
- Previous IA got bogged down in technical fixes and lost sight of original design requirements

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:**
- Add save functionality to `/receipt-demo` for water bills template review (high priority)
- Implement missing design features from original specification:
  - Bank info buttons linking to SAMS account details
  - Account statement buttons linking to unit account history
  - Consumption comparison display ("Last month: 15 m³, This month: 18 m³ (+3 m³)")
  - High usage warning notices for above-average consumption
  - Professional action buttons with touch-friendly, branded styling
- Replace static demo data with live Firebase MCP queries using confirmed working data structure
- Test end-to-end email sending with real AVII data and actual email delivery
- Implement trigger system for payment completion and manual sending

**Blocked Items:**
- Receipt template enhancement (waiting for Water Bills completion)
- HOA Dues templates (waiting for Water Bills completion and Comm module architecture)
- SMS/WhatsApp integration (future expansion after email system complete)

**Phase Transition:** 
Approaching completion of Water Bills Email Templates phase. Next phase will be comprehensive Communications Module implementation for go-live readiness including triggers, logging, and unit report integration.

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:** 
- Water Bills data: `clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/2026-00` (confirmed working with Firebase MCP)
- Water Bills config: `clients/AVII/config/waterBills` (rates, penalties, settings)
- Template configuration: `clients/AVII/config/emailTemplates` (bilingual templates)
- Demo interface: `frontend/sams-ui/src/views/DigitalReceiptDemo.jsx` (needs save functionality and missing design features)
- Backend email service: `backend/controllers/emailService.js` (working with real data, domain-specific routes)
- Template variables: `backend/templates/waterBills/templateVariables.js` (GAAP-compliant, uses SAMS utilities)

**Coordination Strategies:** 
- Use specific technical task assignments with clear success criteria
- Reference working examples (payment receipts) when fixing similar systems
- Leverage Firebase MCP for real data integration rather than static mock data
- Implement save/export functionality for user review and design validation
- Focus on completing original design specifications that were agreed upon
- Test with actual email delivery, not just template processing

**User Preferences:** 
- Direct communication style, minimal explanations unless requested
- Prefers completing features fully rather than partial implementations
- Values maintainable, simple solutions over complex architectures  
- Wants to review template designs visually before final approval
- Focus on production-ready features for go-live capability
- Comprehensive planning preferred but implementation should be focused and complete
- Prioritizes meeting original design requirements over just getting basic functionality working
- Wants to compare current implementation against original design document

## Critical Utilities Context
**MUST USE SAMS utilities to avoid timezone/currency bugs:**
- `getMexicoDate`, `getMexicoDateString` from `backend/utils/timezone.js` (America/Cancun timezone)
- `databaseFieldMappings.centsToDollars`, `formatCurrency` from `utils/databaseFieldMappings.js` (centavos to pesos)
- `getFiscalYear`, `getFiscalYearBounds` from `backend/utils/fiscalYearUtils.js` (AVII uses July-June fiscal year)

## Go-Live Requirements
**MVP Features for Production:**
1. ✅ Water Bills Email - Bilingual templates with real data (90% complete)
2. ⚠️ Complete Design Features - Bank buttons, consumption comparison, warnings  
3. ⚠️ Live Data Integration - Replace static demo with Firebase MCP
4. ⚠️ Email Testing - Verify actual sending works end-to-end
5. ⚠️ Manual Send Triggers - Action buttons for sending emails
6. ⚠️ Communication Logging - Audit trail for all emails sent
7. ⚠️ Unit Reports - Show communication history per unit

**Architecture Foundation Ready:**
- Firebase MCP integration confirmed (36 tools, real AVII data access)
- Domain-specific `/comm/email/` API structure implemented
- Bilingual template system working
- SAMS utilities integration confirmed
- Template variable processing system fixed and working
