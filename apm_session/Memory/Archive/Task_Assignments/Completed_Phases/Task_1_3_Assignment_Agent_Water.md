# Task 1.3 Assignment - Agent_Water

**Date:** 2025-01-10  
**Phase:** 1 - Water Bills Completion  
**Task:** 1.3 - Update Water Readings Storage  
**Agent:** Agent_Water  
**Priority:** High  

## Task Overview
Update the backend water readings storage to handle the new nested data structure from the frontend. Simply store the data as received with no additional processing.

## Current vs New Data Structure

**Current Frontend Sends:**
```javascript
{"101": 1780, "102": 950}
```

**New Frontend Sends:**
```javascript
{
  "101": {reading: 1780, carWashCount: 2, boatWashCount: 1},
  "102": {reading: 950, carWashCount: 0, boatWashCount: 0}
}
```

## Required Changes

**Location:** Backend water readings storage component
**Action:** Update to store nested objects instead of flat numbers
**Storage Path:** `/clients/{clientId}/projects/waterBills/readings/{YYYY-MM}`

## Technical Requirements

1. **Identify the correct backend component** using ACTIVE_MODULES.md
2. **Update storage logic** to handle nested reading objects
3. **Store data exactly as received** from frontend
4. **No data processing** - just storage

## Expected Result

Firebase document structure should become:
```javascript
{
  year: 2025,
  month: 0,
  readings: {
    "101": {reading: 1780, carWashCount: 2, boatWashCount: 1},
    "102": {reading: 950, carWashCount: 0, boatWashCount: 0}
  },
  timestamp: "2025-01-10T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Critical Success Factors
- **DO NOT** work with archived components - use ACTIVE_MODULES.md
- **DO NOT** add any data processing or calculations
- **DO** store the nested structure exactly as received
- **DO** maintain existing API endpoint structure

## Files to Reference
- `ACTIVE_MODULES.md` - For correct component identification
- Backend water readings storage component (to be identified)

**Simple Task:** Just update storage to handle nested objects instead of flat numbers.
