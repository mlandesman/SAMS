# Implementation Agent Handover - Remove duesDistribution Legacy Code

## Immediate Action Required

This is a quick cleanup task that MUST be completed before we fix the import system. We're removing legacy `duesDistribution` code since we're reloading all data fresh.

## Task Assignment

Please execute the task in: `/apm_session/Task_Assignment_Remove_DuesDistribution_Legacy.md`

## Key Points

1. **Why Now:** We're reloading all data, so no need for backward compatibility
2. **Quick Task:** Should take less than 1 hour
3. **Simplifies Imports:** Removes confusion about which field to use
4. **Modern Approach:** Use only `allocations` array going forward

## Files to Modify

1. `/backend/schemas/transactionSchema.js` - Remove field definition
2. `/backend/controllers/hoaDuesController.js` - Remove backward compatibility code  
3. `/backend/controllers/transactionsController.js` - Update getHOAMonthsFromTransaction()
4. Any test files with `duesDistribution` references

## Success Criteria

- Zero references to `duesDistribution` in active code
- HOA payments work with only `allocations` array
- Code is cleaner and ready for import fixes

## Next Steps

After completing this cleanup:
1. Report completion to Manager
2. We'll proceed with the main import fixes task
3. Import logic will be simpler with only one pattern to follow

This is a blocking task - the import fixes cannot proceed until this is complete.
