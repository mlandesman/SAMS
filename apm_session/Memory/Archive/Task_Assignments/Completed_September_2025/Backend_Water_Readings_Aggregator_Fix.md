# Task Log: Backend Water Readings Aggregator Fix for New Data Structure

## Summary
Successfully updated the backend water readings aggregator to handle the new consistent object structure for commonArea/buildingMeter fields and the new washes[] array format. Implemented full backward compatibility while supporting enhanced wash tracking.

## Details
Updated `/backend/services/waterDataService.js` with comprehensive changes:

### Added Helper Functions for Wash Count Processing:
- `getCarWashCount()` - Extracts car wash counts from both new washes[] array and legacy carWashCount field
- `getBoatWashCount()` - Extracts boat wash counts from both formats  
- `getTotalWashCount()` - Calculates total wash count from either format
- `getWashCountsForUnit()` - Returns complete wash count object with details

### Added Special Meter Reading Processor:
- `processSpecialMeterReading()` - Handles both new object structure and legacy flat number format for commonArea/buildingMeter

### Updated Unit Data Processing:
- Modified unit processing loops to use new helper functions for wash counts
- Enhanced currentReading object to include totalWashCount and washDetails
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy carWashCount/boatWashCount fields

### Updated CommonArea/BuildingMeter Processing:
- Replaced hardcoded flat number processing with flexible object/number handling
- Added proper prior reading extraction from new object structure
- Maintained consumption calculation for both formats

## Output
- Modified files: `/backend/services/waterDataService.js`
- Created test file: `/backend/test-water-aggregator.js`
- All wash count helper functions working correctly
- API endpoint `/water/clients/{clientId}/data/{year}` returns enhanced data structure
- Backward compatibility verified for both unit wash counts and special meter readings

## Issues
None

## Important Findings
- The aggregator now supports both legacy flat number format and new consistent object structure
- PWA will receive correct priorReading values for commonArea/buildingMeter from the new object structure
- Enhanced wash tracking includes individual wash dates and types while maintaining compatibility with legacy count fields
- Test results show successful processing of real AVII data with existing structure
- Sample unit wash data confirmed working: carWashes: 1, boatWashes: 0, totalWashes: 1

## Next Steps
- Verify PWA integration with new priorReading values for commonArea/buildingMeter
- Test Desktop UI continues to work with updated aggregated data structure
- Validate email template wash count calculations use new helper functions
- Monitor for any edge cases in production with mixed data formats
