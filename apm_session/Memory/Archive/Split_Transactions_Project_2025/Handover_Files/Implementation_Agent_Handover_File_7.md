# Implementation Agent Handover File - Phase 3 Split Transaction UI Enhancement

## Active Memory Context
**User Preferences:** 
- Demands strict adherence to ID-first architecture principles ("ID = source of truth, names = convenience display only")
- Zero tolerance for hardcoded business data - all data MUST come from configuration files/API
- Requires comprehensive implementation with all edge cases covered
- Values clean, well-documented code with proper error handling
- Expects production-ready implementations, not proof-of-concepts
- Prefers Quicken-style UI patterns for familiar user experience
- Requires thorough testing and verification before claiming completion
- Insists on understanding WHY legacy code exists before removing it
- Expects agents to ASK rather than GUESS when uncertain about data structures

**Working Insights:** 
- SAMS uses UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx as the main expense modal, not ExpenseEntryModal.jsx
- Critical architectural violation was discovered: frontend was stripping IDs and only storing names
- The codebase has strong existing patterns for currency conversion (cents-based storage)
- TransactionTable.jsx uses expandable rows pattern for document indicators
- Context-based state management via useTransactionsContext for modal control
- Backend has robust ID→name resolution capability with hardcoded overrides for special cases
- All business data (categories, vendors, accounts, payment methods) comes from client configuration - NO hardcoding allowed
- cleanTransactionData transformation in TransactionsView.jsx serves critical purpose: converting File objects to document IDs for Firestore compatibility
- Legacy field mapping is REQUIRED to prevent undefined values reaching Firestore (which rejects undefined but accepts null)

## Task Execution Context
**Working Environment:** 
- Backend: `/backend/controllers/transactionsController.js` - Enhanced with ID→name resolution functions and hardcoded override for categoryId: "-split-"
- Frontend Modals: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx` (main modal used)
- Transaction Display: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/TransactionTable.jsx` 
- Split Components: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/transactions/SplitEntryModal.jsx`
- Context Management: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/context/TransactionsContext.jsx`
- Main View: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/views/TransactionsView.jsx` - Contains critical cleanTransactionData transformation
- Utilities: `/frontend/sams-ui/src/utils/databaseFieldMappings.js` (currency conversion)

**Issues Identified:** 
- **RESOLVED**: Critical ID-first architecture violation - forms were stripping IDs and only keeping names
- **RESOLVED**: Categories.map error in SplitEntryModal due to data format mismatch  
- **RESOLVED**: Split amount field starts with 0 instead of empty, causing UX issues (100 becomes 1000)
- **RESOLVED**: Fake confirmation modal after Split Save - now closes directly without modal
- **RESOLVED**: Split transactions sending positive amounts instead of negative to backend
- **RESOLVED**: Undefined fields reaching Firestore - cleanTransactionData transformation prevents this
- **RESOLVED**: Split allocation display styling - now has proper table with borders and alternating rows
- **CURRENT BLOCKER**: Payment method ID resolution failing - backend cannot find paymentMethodId: "etransfer" despite document existing in Firestore at clients/MTC/paymentMethods/etransfer

## Current Context
**Recent User Directives:** 
- User provided Firestore screenshot showing paymentMethods collection structure: document ID "etransfer" contains {name: "eTransfer"}
- User emphasized "ask rather than guess" after agent made incorrect assumptions about data structure
- Confirmed that frontend is correctly sending paymentMethodId: "etransfer" and backend should find this document
- Added debug logging to resolvePaymentMethodName function to identify exact cause of lookup failure

**Working State:** 
- ID-first architecture successfully implemented across entire frontend
- All dropdowns now use IDs as values while displaying names
- Backend enhanced with ID→name resolution functions for robust data handling
- Form state management completely converted to store IDs instead of names
- Transaction submission sends IDs as primary values to backend
- SplitEntryModal uses real category IDs instead of generating fake ones
- cleanTransactionData transformation restored with explicit field mapping to prevent undefined values
- Added debug logging to backend payment method resolution to trace lookup failure

**Task Execution Insights:** 
- Always verify actual component usage via DOM inspection or user screenshots
- SAMS uses sophisticated modal component hierarchy (UnifiedExpenseEntry wraps different modes)
- Currency conversion must use databaseFieldMappings.dollarsToCents() consistently
- Split transactions require categoryName = "-Split-" with categoryId = "-split-" (hardcoded override)
- Never hardcode business data - all must come from client configuration
- ID-first principle is non-negotiable for data integrity
- Legacy code often serves critical purposes that aren't immediately obvious
- Firestore rejects undefined values but accepts null - explicit field mapping with null fallbacks required
- When data exists in database but lookup fails, investigate collection path, document permissions, or database connection issues

## Working Notes
**Development Patterns:** 
- Use cents-based storage throughout with display conversion
- Follow existing context pattern for modal state management
- Implement proper validation before enabling action buttons
- Use consistent error handling and user feedback patterns
- Preserve ID+name object structure throughout data processing
- Always resolve IDs to names for display purposes
- Use explicit field mapping in cleanTransactionData to prevent undefined values reaching Firestore

**Environment Setup:** 
- React components in `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/`
- Specialized transaction components in `/components/transactions/` subdirectory
- CSS files co-located with components using same base name
- Context providers in `/context/` directory for state management
- Backend controllers in `/backend/controllers/` with enhanced ID→name resolution
- Firestore collections follow pattern: `clients/{clientId}/{collection}/{documentId}`

**User Interaction:** 
- User expects immediate visual feedback when functionality is implemented
- Prefers step-by-step explanations of implementation approach
- Values production-ready implementations with edge case coverage
- Requires actual browser verification, not just code review
- Demands strict adherence to architectural principles
- Will catch and call out any violations of configuration-only data principle
- Provides definitive answers when questioned about data structures (e.g., Firestore screenshots)
- Expects agents to trace through actual data flows rather than making assumptions

## Current Status and Next Steps

### ✅ COMPLETED TASKS:
1. **Split Amount Field UX**: Fixed 0 starting value issue
2. **Fake Confirmation Modal**: Removed after Split Save  
3. **Split Allocations Display**: Added styled table with borders and alternating rows
4. **ID-First Architecture**: Complete implementation with proper validation
5. **Backend Category Override**: Added hardcoded "-split-" categoryId support
6. **Amount Sign Issues**: Fixed split transactions sending negative amounts
7. **Undefined Fields**: Restored explicit field mapping in cleanTransactionData
8. **UI Column Layout**: Swapped Amount/Notes columns in split table

### 🔄 CURRENT BLOCKER:
**Payment Method Resolution Failure**: Backend resolvePaymentMethodName function cannot find document with ID "etransfer" despite:
- Frontend correctly sending `paymentMethodId: "etransfer"`
- Firestore document confirmed to exist at `clients/MTC/paymentMethods/etransfer` 
- Document contains `{name: "eTransfer"}` as expected
- Collection path construction appears correct: `clients/${clientId}/paymentMethods`

### 📋 CURRENT TODO STATUS:
```json
[
  {"content": "Debug payment method resolution failure with detailed logging", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high", "id": "debug_payment_method_resolution"},
  {"content": "Fix success modal missing Vendor, Payment Method, Account data", "status": "pending", "priority": "low", "id": "fix_success_modal_data"}
]
```

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION:
Test regular transaction with debug logging enabled in resolvePaymentMethodName function to identify why document lookup fails despite confirmed document existence in Firestore.
