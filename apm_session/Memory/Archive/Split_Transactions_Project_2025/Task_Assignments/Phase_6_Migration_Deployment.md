# Task Assignment: Phase 6 - Split Transactions Migration & Deployment

## Agent Type: Implementation Agent
## Priority: High
## Dependencies: Phase 5 Integration & Testing complete

## Task Overview
Execute the production deployment of split transaction functionality, including database migration, system configuration updates, and user training preparation to ensure seamless transition to the enhanced transaction system.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Production Database Migration**
   - Execute database schema changes in production environment
   - Migrate existing transaction data to new split-compatible structure
   - Validate data integrity post-migration
   - Implement rollback procedures if issues arise

2. **System Configuration and Deployment**
   - Deploy backend API changes to production
   - Update frontend components with split transaction functionality
   - Configure feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Update system monitoring for split transaction operations

3. **User Training and Documentation**
   - Create user guides for split transaction workflows
   - Prepare training materials for Sandy and team
   - Document new administrative procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

4. **Post-Deployment Validation**
   - Monitor system performance with live split transactions
   - Validate real-world split transaction scenarios
   - Confirm backup and recovery procedures work with new schema
   - Assess user adoption and feedback

## Deliverables Required
1. **Production Migration Scripts** - Tested and validated migration procedures
2. **Deployment Checklist** - Step-by-step deployment guide
3. **User Training Materials** - Comprehensive workflow documentation
4. **System Monitoring Configuration** - Enhanced monitoring for split transactions
5. **Post-Deployment Report** - Validation and performance assessment

## Migration Execution Plan
### Pre-Migration Phase
- Backup production database with verified restore procedures
- Validate migration scripts in staging environment
- Coordinate deployment window with minimal business impact
- Prepare communication plan for users during migration
- Set up monitoring and alerting for migration process

### Migration Phase
- Execute database schema changes with minimal downtime
- Run data migration scripts with progress monitoring
- Validate migrated data integrity and completeness
- Deploy backend API updates with split transaction support
- Update frontend applications with new split functionality

### Post-Migration Phase
- Verify all existing transactions display correctly
- Test split transaction creation in production environment
- Monitor system performance and error rates
- Validate backup procedures with new schema
- Enable split transaction features for user testing

## Deployment Strategy
### Gradual Rollout Approach
1. **Phase 6a:** Internal testing with limited user access
2. **Phase 6b:** Sandy and primary users with full split functionality
3. **Phase 6c:** Full deployment to all users
4. **Phase 6d:** Remove feature flags and legacy code cleanup

### Rollback Plan
- Database rollback scripts for schema changes
- Application rollback to previous version
- Data restoration procedures from pre-migration backup
- Communication plan for rollback scenarios
- Timeline for rollback decision making

## User Training Requirements
### Training Materials to Create
- Split transaction creation workflow guide
- Converting existing transactions to splits guide
- Category management with split transactions
- Reporting and search with split functionality
- Troubleshooting common split transaction issues

### Training Delivery Plan
- Initial training session for Sandy (system owner)
- Documentation and video guides for self-service learning
- Follow-up support sessions after initial deployment
- Feedback collection and documentation updates
- Advanced feature training for power users

## System Monitoring and Alerting
### Performance Monitoring
- Split transaction creation/modification response times
- Database query performance for split-related operations
- User interface responsiveness metrics
- Error rates and failure scenarios
- Resource usage patterns with split transactions

### Business Monitoring
- Split transaction adoption rates
- Most common split configurations
- User workflow completion rates
- Support request patterns and issues
- System usage patterns and peak loads

## Post-Deployment Validation
### Technical Validation
- All split transaction workflows function correctly in production
- Performance meets established benchmarks
- Data integrity maintained across all operations
- Backup and recovery procedures validated
- Security measures function correctly

### Business Validation
- Sandy can successfully create and manage split transactions
- Common business scenarios (IVA, commissions, combined payments) work correctly
- Reporting accuracy maintained with split transaction data
- User workflow efficiency improved over previous single-category approach
- System meets go-live readiness requirements

## Risk Management
### Deployment Risks
- Database migration failure or data corruption
- Performance degradation in production environment
- User confusion with new split transaction interface
- Integration issues with existing workflows
- Backup and recovery process complications

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive testing in staging environment
- Gradual rollout with quick rollback capabilities
- User training and support during transition
- Enhanced monitoring during initial deployment period
- Clear escalation procedures for critical issues

## Success Criteria
- Database migration completes successfully with no data loss
- Split transaction functionality works correctly in production
- System performance maintains or exceeds current benchmarks
- Users can successfully create and manage split transactions
- No critical issues discovered in first week of deployment
- Backup and recovery procedures validated with new schema

## Estimated Effort
1-2 Implementation Agent sessions

## Project Completion
Upon successful deployment and validation, split transaction enhancement project is complete and ready for ongoing business use.

## Coordination Notes
- Deployment requires Manager Agent approval and oversight
- Coordinate with business operations to schedule migration window
- Plan communication strategy for users during deployment
- Prepare support procedures for post-deployment issues
- Document lessons learned for future enhancement projects
- Ensure compatibility with upcoming API domain migration timeline
