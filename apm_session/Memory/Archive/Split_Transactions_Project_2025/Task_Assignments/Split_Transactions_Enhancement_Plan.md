# Split Transactions Enhancement - Master Plan

## Overview
Transform SAMS from 1:1 transaction-category model to support split transactions with multiple categories, enabling proper handling of:
- IVA (Value Added Tax) components
- Bank commission charges  
- Combined deposits covering multiple payment types
- Multi-category expense breakdowns

## Business Requirements
- Change category display to "-Split-" for multi-category transactions
- Split modal interface similar to Quicken/financial software
- Maintain transaction amount integrity (splits must sum to total)
- Support all payment types: HOA Dues, Water Bills, general transactions
- Preserve existing single-category transaction functionality

## Technical Impact Areas
- Database schema changes (transactions table)
- Transaction creation/editing workflows
- Search and filtering logic
- Reporting and analytics
- Frontend UI components (modals, tables, forms)
- Backend API endpoints and validation

## Enhancement Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis (Implementation Agent)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 sessions
**Dependencies:** None
**Deliverables:** Comprehensive analysis documents

### Phase 2: Database Design & Migration Strategy (Implementation Agent)
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 sessions  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete
**Deliverables:** Schema design, migration scripts

### Phase 3: Backend API Development (Implementation Agent)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sessions
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete
**Deliverables:** New/updated endpoints, validation logic

### Phase 4: Frontend Components Development (Implementation Agent)
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sessions
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete
**Deliverables:** Split transaction modal, updated forms

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Implementation Agent)
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 sessions
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 complete
**Deliverables:** End-to-end functionality, testing validation

### Phase 6: Migration & Deployment (Implementation Agent)
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 sessions
**Dependencies:** Phase 5 complete
**Deliverables:** Production-ready system

**Total Estimated Effort:** 12-18 Implementation Agent sessions

## Coordination Notes
- Each phase requires Manager Agent review before proceeding
- Database changes require careful planning due to existing data
- UI/UX consistency critical across all transaction entry points
- Backward compatibility considerations for existing single-category transactions
- Integration testing with HOA, Water Bills, and general payment workflows

## Risk Factors
- Database migration complexity with existing transaction data
- Performance impact of split transaction queries
- UI complexity in maintaining intuitive user experience
- Potential breaking changes to existing workflows
- Testing coverage across multiple payment scenarios

## Success Criteria
- Split transactions function identically to Quicken-style interfaces
- All existing transaction functionality preserved
- Performance maintained or improved
- User workflow remains intuitive
- Complete audit trail for split components
