# Task Assignment: Phase 4 - Split Transactions Frontend Components Development

## Agent Type: Implementation Agent
## Priority: High
## Dependencies: Phase 3 Backend API Development complete

## Task Overview
Develop frontend components and user interfaces to support split transaction creation, editing, and display across all SAMS transaction entry points, creating a Quicken-like split transaction experience.

## Specific Objectives
1. **Split Transaction Modal Component**
   - Create SplitTransactionModal with Quicken-style interface
   - Implement dynamic split component addition/removal
   - Add real-time amount validation and balance calculation
   - Include category selection dropdowns for each split
   - Display remaining amount to allocate prominently

2. **Transaction Entry Form Enhancements**
   - Modify transaction creation forms to support split mode
   - Add toggle between single-category and split transaction
   - Integrate split modal into HOA Dues, Water Bills, and general transaction forms
   - Maintain existing form validation while adding split validation

3. **Transaction Display Components**
   - Update transaction tables to show "-Split-" for multi-category transactions
   - Add hover/click functionality to show split component details
   - Create split transaction summary views
   - Enhance transaction detail pages with split component breakdown

4. **Search and Filter UI Updates**
   - Modify category filters to work with split transaction components
   - Update search results to show split transaction matches
   - Add "Show Split Details" toggle for transaction lists
   - Enhance category-based reporting views for split allocations

## Deliverables Required
1. **SplitTransactionModal.jsx** - Core split transaction interface
2. **Enhanced Transaction Forms** - Updated entry components
3. **Split Transaction Display Components** - Table and detail views
4. **Updated Search/Filter Components** - Split-aware filtering
5. **Component Tests** - Comprehensive UI testing
6. **User Experience Documentation** - Workflow guides

## UI Components to Create/Modify
- `SplitTransactionModal.jsx` - Primary split editing interface
- `TransactionForm.jsx` - Enhanced for split support
- `TransactionTable.jsx` - Display split transactions
- `TransactionDetail.jsx` - Show split component breakdown
- `CategoryFilter.jsx` - Filter by split categories
- `TransactionSearch.jsx` - Search across split components

## User Experience Requirements
- Intuitive toggle between single and split transaction modes
- Clear visual indication of split transactions in lists
- Easy addition/removal of split components
- Real-time balance validation feedback
- Category selection similar to existing SAMS patterns
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use

## Split Modal Interface Specifications
- **Header:** Transaction amount and remaining to allocate
- **Split Rows:** Category dropdown, amount input, description field
- **Actions:** Add Split, Remove Split, Save, Cancel
- **Validation:** Real-time amount checking, error highlighting
- **Footer:** Total allocated, remaining amount, balance status

## Integration Points
- HOA Dues payment entry with split allocation
- Water Bills payment with IVA/commission splits
- General transaction entry with multi-category support
- Transaction editing workflows
- Category budget displays with split considerations
- Reporting views with split component aggregation

## Validation UI Requirements
- Visual feedback for amount mismatches
- Prevent saving when splits don't total transaction amount
- Highlight invalid split components
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Disable save button until validation passes
- Show running total as splits are added/modified

## Responsive Design Considerations
- Mobile-friendly split modal interface
- Touch-optimized split component controls
- Collapsible split details in narrow views
- Accessible keyboard navigation for split editing
- Consistent styling with existing SAMS components

## User Workflow Enhancements
- Convert existing transaction to split with one click
- Bulk split template creation for common scenarios
- Split transaction copying/duplicating functionality
- Undo/redo support for split modifications
- Auto-save draft splits to prevent data loss

## Performance Requirements
- Fast modal loading for large transaction amounts
- Smooth addition/removal of split components
- Efficient category dropdown loading
- Minimal re-renders during split editing
- Optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness

## Success Criteria
- Split transaction creation matches Quicken usability
- All existing transaction workflows support split mode
- UI performance maintains current standards
- Mobile experience equals desktop functionality
- User testing validates intuitive workflow
- Visual consistency with existing SAMS design

## Estimated Effort
3-4 Implementation Agent sessions

## Next Phase
Upon completion, Phase 5: Integration & Testing

## Coordination Notes
- UI/UX requires Manager Agent approval before implementation
- Coordinate with ongoing Water Bills UI completion
- Ensure consistent styling with existing components
- Plan user acceptance testing approach
- Consider phased rollout starting with general transactions
- Document new user workflows for training materials
