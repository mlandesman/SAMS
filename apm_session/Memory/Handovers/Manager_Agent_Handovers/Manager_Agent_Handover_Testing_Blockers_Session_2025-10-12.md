## Active Memory Context

### Session Accomplishments (October 12, 2025)

**Major Achievement:** Resolved all testing blockers and deployed v0.0.11 with 100% completion rate

**Testing Blockers Resolution (GitHub Issue #15):**
1. **Payment Methods Import Status** - Fixed import to set `status: "active"` (4 files, commit c92a27c)
2. **Expense Entry Modal Filter** - Added active-only filtering (1 file, PR #18, commit 314fe49)
3. **Document Upload 500 Error** - Fixed Firebase storage bucket init (1 file, PR #19, commit 29ecc43)

**Emergency Production Fix (GitHub Issue #21):**
- **Water Bills Payment Bug** - Fixed `currentYear` undefined error (2 lines, PR #23, commit 5c2391a)
- Critical blocker preventing water bills payments
- 30-minute emergency response, user verified with real AVII data

**Architectural Enhancement Task Created (GitHub Issues #22 + #11):**
- **Water Bills Aggregated Data Architecture** - Comprehensive solution for cache invalidation and performance
- Solves O(n²) carryover recalculation problem
- Enables surgical cache updates after payments
- Currently assigned to Agent_Water_Performance

### User Directives

**Strategic Direction:**
- Focus on Priority 3 sequence (3a → 3b → 3c) for Statement of Account Report
- Foundation-First approach (build dependencies before main feature)
- Quality over speed (all 4 tasks today received "Fully Approved" reviews)

**Priority Sequencing Clarified:**
- Priority 1 (Credit Balance) was completed months ago - removed from active priorities
- Priority 3a (Water Bills Split Transactions) needs fresh implementation (feature branch unmergeable)
- Water Bills Aggregated Data (Issues #22/#11) must complete BEFORE Priority 3a testing

**Git Workflow Preference:**
- Each task on separate branch for isolation
- Professional commit messages with issue references
- Fast-track merges for approved work
- Clean git history maintained

**Testing Requirements:**
- User verification for all critical fixes
- Real data testing (AVII/MTC clients)
- No false success claims without proof
- Documentation of testing results

### Decisions Made

**Technical Debt TD-017:**
- 1st Gen Cloud Function (`checkExchangeRatesHealth`) needs migration to 2nd Gen
- Priority: LOW (no production impact)
- Deferred to next Firebase Functions maintenance window
- Discovered during v0.0.11 deployment

**Priority 3a Restoration Strategy:**
- Feature branch `feature/water-bills-split-transactions` unmergeable (99K+ lines diverged)
- Cannot safely merge (would revert Firebase migration)
- Decision: Fresh implementation against current main branch
- Use commit ea88f12 as reference only
- Schedule after Water Bills Aggregated Data completion

**Cache Architecture (Issues #22 + #11):**
- Implement timestamp-based cache validation (no TTL)
- Three-tier caching: sessionStorage → aggregatedData document → on-demand calculation
- Document location: `/clients/{clientId}/projects/waterBills/bills/aggregatedData`
- Surgical updates after payments (no full recalculation)

---

## Coordination Status

### Producer-Consumer Dependencies

**Completed Dependencies:**
- ✅ Testing blockers resolved → Future client imports will work
- ✅ Payment methods import fixed → Dropdowns populated correctly
- ✅ Document upload fixed → Can attach receipts to transactions
- ✅ Emergency fix deployed → Water bills payments functional

**Active Dependencies:**
- ⏳ **Water Bills Aggregated Data** (Agent_Water_Performance working)
  → Blocks Priority 3a testing (cannot verify split transactions without cache refresh)
  → Blocks Priority 0 completion (performance optimization)
  → Enables Issues #22 and #11 resolution

**Future Dependencies (Per Priority 3 Roadmap):**
- **Priority 3a** (Water Bills Split Transactions) → Enables Priority 3c (Statement of Account)
- **Priority 3b** (HOA Quarterly Collection) → Enables Priority 3c (Statement of Account)
- **Priority 3c** (Statement of Account Report) - Requires 3a + 3b foundations

### Coordination Insights

**Implementation Agent Quality:**
- All 4 agents this session delivered "Fully Approved" work
- Comprehensive documentation (2000+ lines total)
- Professional git workflows
- User verification completion rate: 100%

**Effective Patterns:**
- Separate branches per task prevents conflicts
- Multi-step tasks with user confirmation work well for complex changes
- Emergency response workflow successful (30-minute turnaround)
- Auto-archiving keeps workspace clean

**Communication Preferences:**
- User appreciates strategic bundling (Issues #22+#11 together)
- Prefers discussion before implementation (cache architecture)
- Values proper git workflow (branches, PRs, clean commits)
- Expects Manager Agent to challenge and clarify (good collaboration)

## Working Notes

### File Patterns
- **Task Assignments:** `apm_session/Memory/Task_Assignments/Active/` and `Completed/`
- **Task Completion Logs:** `apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/`
- **Manager Reviews:** `apm_session/Memory/Reviews/`
- **Implementation Plan:** `apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md`
- **Project Tracking:** `PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md`
- **Memory Root:** `apm_session/Memory/Memory_Root.md`

### Coordination Strategies
- **Emergency Response:** Create hotfix branch, fast-track review, immediate merge
- **Bundled Fixes:** Group related issues (Issues #22+#11) for architectural solutions
- **Multi-Step Tasks:** Use for complex changes requiring validation between steps
- **Auto-Archiving:** Move completed tasks to Completed/, resolved issues to resolved/

### User Preferences
- **Strategic Thinking:** Appreciates architectural solutions over band-aids
- **Discussion First:** Wants to talk through approach before implementation
- **Git Discipline:** Separate branches, clean commits, professional PRs
- **Testing Rigor:** Real data (AVII/MTC), user verification, no assumptions
- **Documentation:** Values comprehensive Memory Logs and reviews
- **Collaboration:** Expects Manager to challenge, clarify, and push back constructively

### Critical Code Patterns
- **Date Handling:** Always use `getNow()` from DateService, never `new Date()`
- **ES6 Modules:** All backend code uses ES6 exports (CommonJS breaks system)
- **Timezone:** All dates normalized to America/Cancun
- **Firestore Paths:** Domain-specific routes (`/hoadues/`, `/water/`, etc.)
- **Backend Duplication:** Both `backend/` and `functions/backend/` must stay synchronized

## Key Discoveries This Session

### Technical Findings

**1. Priority 3a Feature Branch Unmergeable:**
- Commit ea88f12 contains Water Bills Split Transactions implementation
- Branch `feature/water-bills-split-transactions` diverged 99,000+ lines from main
- Cannot merge without reverting Firebase Cloud Functions migration
- Solution: Fresh implementation using ea88f12 as reference only

**2. O(n²) Carryover Recalculation:**
- Each month recalculates all previous months (Month 11 recalcs months 0-10)
- 3 months of bills = 10 seconds load time
- 12 months estimated = 30-40+ seconds
- Solution: Pre-aggregated data architecture (currently being implemented)

**3. Cache Lives in sessionStorage:**
- Key: `water_bills_{clientId}_{year}`
- Structure: `{ data: {...}, timestamp: ... }`
- Duration: Was 30 minutes TTL
- New: Timestamp-based validation (no TTL)

**4. TD-017 1st Gen Function:**
- `checkExchangeRatesHealth` still on 1st Gen
- Cannot auto-migrate (Firebase limitation)
- Low priority (no production impact)
- Documented in PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md

### Process Improvements

**1. Multi-Issue Bundling:**
- Issues #22 (cache) + #11 (performance) solved with one architectural change
- More efficient than separate fixes
- Better long-term solution

**2. Emergency Response Workflow:**
- Hotfix branch strategy effective
- 30-minute turnaround for critical bugs
- User verification before merge
- Fast-track review process

**3. Auto-Archiving Protocol:**
- Completed tasks moved to Completed/ folder
- Resolved issues moved to resolved/ folder
- Keeps active workspace clean
- Prevents confusion about task status

---

## Pending Work (After Current Task)

### Immediate Next: Priority 3a - Water Bills Split Transactions
**Status:** Needs fresh task assignment (old feature branch unmergeable)

**Background:**
- Originally implemented on `feature/water-bills-split-transactions` (commit ea88f12)
- Feature branch now 99,000+ lines diverged from main (Firebase migration happened)
- Cannot merge without catastrophic reversions
- Must reimplement fresh against current main

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use ea88f12 as reference for function signatures and logic
- Write against current `waterPaymentsService.js` and `importService.js`
- Apply HOA Dues `allocations[]` pattern to Water Bills
- Separate base charges from penalties as distinct line items
- Test with current aggregatedData architecture

**Estimated:** 4-5 hours
**Priority:** Foundation for Statement of Account (Priority 3c)

### Then: Priority 3b - HOA Dues Quarterly Collection
**Status:** Task assignment exists in Active/ folder
**File:** `Task_Assignment_Fix_HOA_Dues_Unnecessary_Split_Allocations.md` (may need review - might be wrong file)
**Estimated:** 4-5 hours
**Purpose:** Quarterly view for AVII client (foundation for Statement of Account)

### Then: Priority 3c - Statement of Account Report
**Status:** Task assignment exists in Active/ folder
**File:** `Task_Assignment_Statement_of_Account_Report_System.md`
**Estimated:** 8-10 hours
**Goal:** Professional client-branded reports (major milestone)

---

## User Directives (Recent/Unlogged)

**Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Foundation-First Approach:** Build dependencies (3a, 3b) before Statement of Account (3c)
2. **Quality Focus:** All work must be user-verified before approval
3. **Architectural Solutions:** Prefer comprehensive fixes over band-aids (e.g., Issues #22+#11 bundled)
4. **Git Discipline:** Separate branches, proper PRs, no force-merges

**Performance Emphasis:**
- Water Bills performance is critical (10 seconds unacceptable)
- Aggregated data architecture solves multiple problems
- Timestamp-based cache validation preferred over TTL
- Usage pattern: "Static most of month, burst activity at start"

**Testing Standards:**
- Real AVII/MTC client data required
- User verification mandatory before merge
- No assumptions about functionality
- Document all testing results

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Comprehensive Memory Logs for all tasks
- Manager Reviews for quality gates
- Update all tracking documents (Implementation Plan, Project Tracking, Memory Root)
- Follow Dynamic-MD Memory System structure

---

## Critical Context for Incoming Manager

### Priority 3 Roadmap (Foundation-First Strategy)

**From:** `apm_session/Priority_3_Roadmap_Statement_of_Account.md` (October 10, 2025)

**Sequence:** 3a → 3b → 3c
**Total Effort:** 16-20 hours
**Strategy:** Build foundations first to prevent rework

**Why This Sequence:**
- **Priority 3a:** Water Bills Split Transactions - Enables penalty breakdown in Statement of Account
- **Priority 3b:** HOA Quarterly Collection - Enables quarterly view in Statement of Account
- **Priority 3c:** Statement of Account Report - Uses both foundations, no rework needed

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Statement of Account pulls from transactions collection
- Without 3a: Cannot show penalty breakdown
- Without 3b: AVII quarterly view won't work
- Building 3c first = immediate rework after 3a and 3b

### Water Bills Architecture Evolution

**Phase 1 (Complete):** Basic water bills system operational
**Phase 2 (In Progress):** Aggregated data architecture for performance
**Phase 3 (Next):** Split transactions with allocations[] (Priority 3a)
**Phase 4 (Future):** Nightly maintenance for penalty recalculation

**Current State:**
- Water bills payments functional (emergency fix deployed)
- Performance optimization in progress (Issues #22+#11)
- Split transactions needed for Statement of Account
- Foundation being built correctly

### Git Repository State

**Main Branch:** Clean, synced, v0.0.11 deployed
**Feature Branches:**
- `feature/water-bills-aggregated-data` (active - Agent_Water_Performance)
- `feature/water-bills-split-transactions` (unmergeable - 99K+ divergence, do not merge)

**Recent Commits:**
- eb1e903: Task assignment for aggregated data
- 9ce8f3b: Manager review for emergency fix
- bca5794: Documentation updates
- d9548a9: Emergency hotfix merged (PR #23)
