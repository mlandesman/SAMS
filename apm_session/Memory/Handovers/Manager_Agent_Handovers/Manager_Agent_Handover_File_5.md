## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:** 
- Michael manually fixed Credit Balance Edit Notes issue (notes not saving during manual adjustment)
- Added new requirement: Credit Balance revert feature (ability to undo last adjustment)
- Added significant new task: Update Purge and Import Tools for new data structures/endpoints (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Prioritized Water Bills fixes as immediate work (now COMPLETE)
- New archival policy: Move ALL files that could confuse agents (assignments, reviews, handovers) to archive
- Implementation Agent encountered date handling issue - tried using `new Date()` and `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instead of our utilities
- Michael concerned about verifying HOA Dues to Transaction cross-references in import process
- Discovered most import scripts referenced in run-complete-import.sh are missing and need creation
- Current purge script already has safety features (environment checks, confirmations) but needs dry-run mode

**Decisions:** 
- Water Bills fixes took priority over other tasks (now COMPLETE) 
- Purge/Import Tools update inserted as high priority between Water Bills and HOA Quarterly
- Credit Balance revert feature added as low priority enhancement
- Implemented comprehensive archival strategy moving all completed work
- Helped Implementation Agent understand proper date handling using DateService utilities

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- Water Bills Fixes COMPLETE → Ready to assign Purge/Import Tools Update
- All date handling infrastructure solid → No blockers for any tasks
- Credit Balance fixes mostly complete → Only revert feature pending

**Coordination Insights:** 
- Implementation Agents sometimes forget to use our date utilities - need to remind them about CRITICAL_CODING_GUIDELINES.md
- Water Bills fixes completed much faster than estimated (75 min vs 1-2 sessions)
- Ad-hoc formatting requests from Michael are common - be flexible
- Michael prefers immediate action over discussion for small fixes

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:** 
- Purge/Import Tools Update task assignment CREATED at apm_session/Task_Assignment_Purge_Import_Tools_Update.md (4 phases, 3-4 sessions)
- HOA Dues Quarterly Collection task assignment needs preparation (NEXT PRIORITY)
- Credit Balance revert feature task assignment pending
- Edit Transactions Enhancement task assignment pending

**Blocked Items:** None

**Phase Transition:** 
- Water Bills fixes (Priority 2) COMPLETE
- Next: Create Purge/Import Tools Update task (inserted priority)
- Then: HOA Quarterly Collection (Priority 3)

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:** 
- Task assignments: apm_session/Task_Assignment_*.md
- Reviews: apm_session/Memory/Reviews/
- Archives: apm_session/Memory/Archive/
- Implementation Plan: apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md

**Coordination Strategies:** 
- Always check CRITICAL_CODING_GUIDELINES.md when Implementation Agents have date/time issues
- Create focused task assignments with clear acceptance criteria
- Archive immediately after successful completion
- Be ready for ad-hoc requests during implementations

**User Preferences:** 
- Prefers action over discussion for small fixes
- Values clean workspace organization  
- Wants comprehensive archival to prevent confusion
- Expects clear priority management
- Likes when we push back if something seems wrong

## Technical Context
**Recent Completions:**
- TD-005: Credit Balance Delete Reversal - FIXED (commit: c151978)
- TD-006: Transaction Date Timezone Fix - FIXED (commit: 9e496a0)
- Priority 2: Water Bills Fixes (Tasks 2.1-2.5) - COMPLETE (September 29, 2025)
- Ad-hoc: Water Bills History Table Formatting - COMPLETE (matches HOA Dues)

**Current Branch:** fix-water-bills-issues (should be merged/cleaned up)

**Date Handling Reminder:**
When Implementation Agents try to use `new Date()` or `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, redirect them to:
- Backend: `import { DateService, defaultDateService, getNow } from '../services/DateService.js';`
- Use `getNow()` instead of `new Date()`
- Use `DateService.formatForFrontend()` for timestamp formatting
- Frontend receives pre-formatted dates from backend
