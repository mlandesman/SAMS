## Active Memory Context
**User Directives:** 
- Import system successfully fixed and tested by Implementation Agent
- Ready to proceed with HOA Quarterly Collection feature now that imports work
- Focus on data-driven architecture for client flexibility
- Use controllers for all operations, no direct Firebase calls

**Decisions:** 
- Approved Import CrossRef Logic fix with EXCELLENT rating
- Auto-archived completed task and updated Implementation Plan
- Import system now marked as COMPLETE in Implementation Plan
- Ready to create HOA Quarterly Collection task assignment

## Coordination Status
**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- Import fixes COMPLETE → HOA Quarterly Collection READY to start
- HOA Quarterly Collection BLOCKING → HOA Late Fee Penalties feature
- HOA Quarterly Collection BLOCKING → Quarterly-based reporting features
- Credit Balance revert/delete feature INDEPENDENT → Can proceed anytime

**Coordination Insights:** 
- Import system now fully functional with dynamic CrossRef generation
- Two-phase HOA import process working correctly
- Test suite available for verification
- Clear path forward for quarterly collection support

## Next Actions
**Ready Assignments:** 
- Create Task Assignment for HOA Quarterly Collection feature (Priority 3)
- Need to review requirements for quarterly view logic
- Consider fiscal calendar integration requirements
- Plan partial payment tracking approach

**Blocked Items:** 
- Priority 4: HOA Late Fee Penalties (waiting for quarterly collection)
- Quarterly financial reporting (needs quarterly collection foundation)

**Phase Transition:** 
- Moving from critical fixes to feature enhancement phase
- Import blocker removed allows multiple features to proceed
- Consider creating multiple task assignments for parallel work

## Working Notes
**File Patterns:** 
- Task assignments: /apm_session/Task_Assignment_*.md
- Implementation handovers: /apm_session/Memory/Handovers/Implementation_Agent_Handovers/*.md
- Completed tasks archive: /apm_session/Memory/Archive/Task_Assignments/Completed/*.md
- Reviews: /apm_session/Memory/Reviews/*.md

**Key HOA Quarterly Insights:**
- Config location: /clients/:clientId/config.feeStructure.duesFrequency
- When set to "quarterly", change HOA Dues table view
- Quarters based on fiscal calendar configuration
- Penalties calculated on quarterly amounts, not monthly

**Coordination Strategies:** 
- Break complex features into clear phases
- Provide data structure examples in task assignments
- Include test approaches in task requirements
- Reference existing patterns (Water Bills penalty system for HOA penalties)

**User Preferences:** 
- Wants systematic implementation, not quick patches
- Values data-driven architecture for flexibility
- Expects proper testing before claiming completion
- Prefers clear understanding of requirements before coding

## Critical Information for Next Manager
1. **HIGHEST PRIORITY**: Create HOA Quarterly Collection task assignment
2. **REMEMBER** Config drives the quarterly vs monthly display logic
3. **CONSIDER** Parallel task assignments now that imports work
4. **VERIFY** Understanding of fiscal calendar requirements
5. **PLAN** For partial payment tracking complexity

The import fixes have unblocked significant progress opportunities. Multiple features can now proceed.
