```

## Active Memory Context

**User Directives:** 
- User provided screenshots showing critical displayDue calculation bug in Water Bills payment modal
- Unit 105 shows $1.00 total due instead of $202.50 (missing overdue + penalties)
- User emphasized this is HIGH priority as it affects user-facing functionality
- User requested immediate assignment of WB1B-Followup task
- User provided performance analysis correction for WB2 (6x-9x speedup vs initial 1.21x report)

**Decisions:**
- All 5 completed tasks received 5-star Manager reviews and were auto-archived
- WB1B-Followup identified as HIGH priority due to user-facing impact
- WB3 and WB4 remain MEDIUM priority pending WB1B-Followup completion
- Auto-archive process completed per manager-review-enhanced instructions
- Phase progress: 62.5% complete (5 of 8 tasks)

## Coordination Status

**Producer-Consumer Dependencies:**
- WB1 (Backend centavos) → WB1A (Architecture validation) → WB1B (Frontend alignment) → WB1B-Followup (Bug fix)
- WB2 (Penalty optimization) → WB3 (Surgical update verification) 
- WB5 (Import fixes) → Ready for production testing
- WB4 (Delete transaction fix) → Independent, can run parallel

**Coordination Insights:**
- Implementation Agents consistently deliver 5-star work with comprehensive documentation
- User provides excellent technical feedback and corrections (WB2 performance analysis)
- Auto-archive process works smoothly when tasks are properly completed
- User prefers immediate task assignment when blockers are identified

## Next Actions

**Ready Assignments:**
- **WB1B-Followup** → Implementation Agent (HIGH priority, 1 hour)
  - Simple backend bug fix in waterDataService.js
  - displayDue = billAmount + displayOverdue + displayPenalties
  - User-facing impact requires immediate attention

**Blocked Items:**
- WB3 (Surgical Update Verification) → Blocked waiting for WB1B-Followup completion
- WB4 (Delete Transaction Fix) → Can proceed independently

**Phase Transition:**
- After WB1B-Followup, WB3, WB4 completion → Water Bills module will be COMPLETE
- Next phase: Apply Water Bills patterns to HOA Dues module
- Estimated completion: 5-7 hours remaining

## Working Notes

**File Patterns:**
- Task assignments: `apm_session/Memory/Task_Assignments/Active/`
- Completed tasks: `apm_session/Memory/Task_Assignments/Completed/`
- Memory logs: `apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/Completed/`
- Manager reviews: `apm_session/Memory/Reviews/`
- Implementation Plan: `apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md`
- Memory Root: `apm_session/Memory/Memory_Root.md`

**Coordination Strategies:**
- Always use manager-review-enhanced process for completed tasks
- Auto-archive only when tasks receive 5-star approval
- Create comprehensive task assignments with clear acceptance criteria
- Update all tracking documents after each task completion
- Prioritize user-facing bugs immediately

**User Preferences:**
- Communication: Direct, technical, results-focused
- Task breakdown: Clear acceptance criteria, comprehensive documentation
- Quality expectations: 5-star reviews, zero linting errors, 100% test pass rate
- Explanation preferences: Technical details with performance metrics

## Critical Issue Analysis

**Current Blocker: displayDue Calculation Bug**
- **Location:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js`
- **Issue:** displayDue only includes billAmount, missing displayOverdue + displayPenalties
- **Impact:** User sees incorrect totals in payment modal ($1.00 vs $202.50)
- **Evidence:** User provided screenshots showing Unit 105 payment modal
- **Fix:** Simple addition: `displayDue = billAmount + displayOverdue + displayPenalties`
- **Priority:** HIGH (user-facing, affects payment decisions)

## Phase Achievement Summary

**Completed Tasks (5):**
1. **WB1:** Backend centavos storage (100x API efficiency)
2. **WB1A:** Architecture validation (optimal design confirmed)  
3. **WB2:** Penalty optimization (6x-9x payment speedup)
4. **WB1B:** Frontend pre-calculated values (50% code reduction)
5. **WB5:** Import fixes (Issue #7 resolved)

**Performance Gains:**
- 100x API efficiency improvement
- 6x-9x payment operation speedup  
- 83.3% bill processing reduction
- 50% frontend code reduction

**Quality Metrics:**
- Zero linting errors across all tasks
- 100% test pass rate (all test suites)
- 5-star reviews on all completed tasks
- Backward compatible implementations

## Archive Status

**Auto-Archive Completed:**
- 4 task assignments moved to Completed/
- 5 completion logs moved to Completed/
- 5 manager reviews created and preserved
- TODO list updated (5 completed, 3 pending)
- All tracking documents updated
- Phase summary and archive log created

**Files Archived:**
- Task_WB1_Backend_Data_Structure_Floating_Point.md
- Task_WB1A_Frontend_Conversion_Centavos.md  
- Task_WB1B_Frontend_Use_Precalculated_Values.md
- Task_WB2_Penalty_Calc_Optimization.md
- All corresponding completion logs and manager reviews

## Immediate Next Action

**CRITICAL:** Assign WB1B-Followup task immediately
- User has provided evidence of displayDue calculation bug
- This is a HIGH priority user-facing issue
- Simple 1-hour fix in waterDataService.js
- Blocks clean production deployment

**Task Assignment Required:**
- Create task assignment for WB1B-Followup
- Assign to Implementation Agent
- Update all tracking documents
- Monitor for completion and review
