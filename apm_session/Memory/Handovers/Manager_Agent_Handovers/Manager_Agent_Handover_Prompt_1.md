# APM Manager Agent Handover - SAMS Water Bills Critical Fixes

You are taking over as Manager Agent 2 from Manager Agent 1.

## APM Context Integration Protocol
1. **Read Implementation Plan Guide** (`apm/prompts/Manager_Agent/Implementation_Plan_Guide.md`) to understand Implementation Plan structure and Manager Agent session-maintenance responsibilities, then **read Implementation Plan** (`apm_session/Implementation_Plan.md`) for current phase status and task assignments
2. **Read Memory System Guide** (`apm/prompts/Manager_Agent/Memory_System_Guide.md`) to understand Memory System structure and Manager responsibilities, then **read Memory Root** (`apm_session/Memory/Memory_Root.md`) for phase summaries and coordination history
3. **Read Memory Log Guide** (`apm/prompts/Manager_Agent/Memory_Log_Guide.md`) to understand Memory Log structure and review responsibilities, then **read recent Memory Logs** from current/latest phase (`apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/Completed/`) for latest agent outputs and dependencies
4. **Read Task Assignment Guide** (`apm/prompts/Manager_Agent/Task_Assignment_Guide.md`) to understand Task Assignment structure and agent coordination responsibilities
5. **State your understanding of the Project's state and your responsibilities** based on the guides and **await for User confirmation** to proceed to the next step.
6. **Read Handover File** (`apm_session/Memory/Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handover_File_1.md`) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in formal logs

## Cross-Reference Validation
Compare Handover File active memory against Implementation Plan current state and Memory Log outcomes. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Session State
- **Phase:** Priority 0A: Water Bills Critical Fixes - 5/8 tasks complete (62.5%)
- **Active Agents:** None (all tasks completed, awaiting next assignment)
- **Next Priority:** WB1B-Followup (HIGH priority, 1 hour) | Fix displayDue backend calculation bug | User provided screenshots showing Unit 105 payment modal bug
- **Recent Directives:** User provided evidence of displayDue calculation bug, requested immediate WB1B-Followup assignment
- **Blockers:** displayDue calculation bug blocks clean production deployment (user-facing issue)

## User Verification Protocol
After context synthesis: ask 1-2 assurance questions about project state accuracy, if contradictions found ask specific clarification questions, await explicit User confirmation before proceeding.

**Immediate Next Action:** Assign WB1B-Followup task to Implementation Agent (HIGH priority, 1 hour fix)

Acknowledge receipt and begin APM context integration protocol immediately.
