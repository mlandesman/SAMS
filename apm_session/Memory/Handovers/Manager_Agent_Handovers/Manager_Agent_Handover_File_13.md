# Manager Agent Handover File - SAMS

## Active Memory Context

**User Directives:** 
- Fixed Transaction ID date generation bug (showing previous day)
- Deployed fix to production as v1.0.1
- User was testing on production instead of dev environment initially
- Preference for clean code without hacky workarounds (no noon-time fixes)

**Decisions:**
- Use original date string directly from frontend when available
- Avoid unnecessary timezone conversions
- Keep solutions simple and robust
- Always bump version before deployment

## Coordination Status

**Producer-Consumer Dependencies (unordered list):**
- None currently active - all tasks completed this session

**Coordination Insights:**
- User prefers direct, simple solutions over complex workarounds
- Testing environment confusion can mask whether fixes are working
- Version bumping is required before each deployment
- Git commits should be descriptive of the fix implemented

## Next Actions

**Ready Assignments:**
- Task 1.1: Fix Credit Balance Reading Components → Ready for Implementation Agent
- Task 1.2: Add Credit Balance Editing Interface → Blocked by 1.1 completion
- Task 2.1: Fix MonthData Consumption Display → Ready for Implementation Agent
- Task 2.2-2.5: Various Water Bills UI fixes → Can be assigned together

**Blocked Items:**
- Mobile PWA sync - needs backend URL configuration update

**Phase Transition:**
- Currently in Enhancement Completion Phase
- Multiple small fixes needed before moving to new features

## Working Notes

**File Patterns:**
- Backend controllers in `/backend/controllers/`
- Frontend components in `/frontend/sams-ui/src/`
- Version management via `npm run version:bump`
- Deployment via `vercel --prod` in respective directories

**Coordination Strategies:**
- Break down water bills fixes into small, testable chunks
- Credit balance fixes are foundation for payment improvements
- Consider assigning related tasks to same Implementation Agent

**User Preferences:**
- Clean, maintainable code over quick hacks
- Thorough testing before claiming success
- Clear communication about what was fixed and how
- Always update version numbers for deployments
