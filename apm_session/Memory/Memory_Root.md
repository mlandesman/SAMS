Implementation Plan Phase Summaries are to be stored here; detailed Task Memory Logs are stored in Markdown format in the sub-directories.

## Project Context

**Project:** SAMS (Sandy's Accounting Management System)
**Objective:** Complete critical features to achieve production-ready status for parallel operation with Google Sheets systems
**Key Focus Areas:**
- Water Bills module completion with car/boat wash billing
- API architecture refactoring to domain-specific endpoints
- PWA recovery and mobile admin functionality
- Automated reporting with bilingual (English/Spanish) support

**Technical Context:**
- Frontend: React/Vite on localhost:5173
- Backend: Node.js/Express on localhost:5001
- PWA: localhost:5174 (broken, needs recovery)
- Database: Firebase/Firestore
- Production: sams.sandyland.com.mx

**Critical Constraints:**
- No backward compatibility needed (fresh system)
- User approval required for all commits
- Linear workflow with single Implementation Agent at a time
- Leverage existing HOA patterns for Water Bills features
- Bilingual support required throughout
