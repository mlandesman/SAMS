   - Code simplified with clear comments
   - **Discovered:** Backend displayDue calculation bug (WB1B-Followup created)
   - **Bonus:** Documented 4 areas where backend doesn't provide pre-calculated values

5. **WB5: Import Due Dates + Centavos** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed due date calculation (bill month day 10, not import date + 10)
   - Implemented currency conversion (pesos ‚Üí centavos during import)
   - Backward compatible with optional parameters
   - 4/4 test suites passing (100%)
   - Production ready for historical data re-import

6. **WB_DATA_FIX: Water Bills Data Architecture Fix** ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025)
   - **Critical Achievement:** Fixed payment modal showing $1.00 instead of $301.50+
   - **Backend Fixes:** Resolved credit balance double-dipping bug, proper underpayment/overpayment logic
   - **Frontend Improvements:** Restored colored status indicators, improved modal compactness
   - **API Enhancement:** Added currentCreditBalance to preview API response
   - **Architecture Compliance:** Maintained centavos/pesos conversion throughout
   - **Testing:** All three payment scenarios verified (underpayment, overpayment, exact payment)
   - **Production Ready:** Zero breaking changes, backward compatible
   - **Manager Review:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê APPROVED - Ready for production deployment

### ‚è≥ Next Priority:
- **WB_DATA_MODEL_FIX: Optimize aggregatedData Generation** (MEDIUM - 2-3 hours)
  - Generate aggregatedData only for months with bills/readings (not all 12 months)
  - Backend change + cascading frontend updates
  - Performance improvement and cleaner architecture

## üìä Project Overview

### What We're Fixing:
**Water Bills Module** - Critical architecture and performance issues

### Why It Matters:
Water Bills is the **reference implementation** for HOA Dues and future modules. The backend architecture (centavos storage + API conversion) will be the standard for all financial modules.

### Timeline:
- **WB1 (Backend Architecture):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB1A (Architecture Validation):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB2 (Penalty Optimization):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB1B (Frontend Pre-Calculated Values):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB5 (Import Due Dates + Centavos):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB_DATA_FIX (Payment Modal + Credit System):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB_DATA_MODEL_FIX (Optimize Month Generation):** Ready ‚è≥ (MEDIUM - 2-3 hrs)
- **Target:** Water Bills "rock solid" foundation ACHIEVED ‚úÖ
- **Next:** HOA Dues migration using Water Bills architecture patterns

## üîß Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture:
1. **Backend Currency Storage:** All amounts stored as integer centavos
   - Eliminates floating point precision errors
   - Exact financial calculations
   - Consistent with HOA Dues and Transactions modules

2. **API Conversion Layer:** Backend centavos ‚Üí API pesos
   - Single conversion per request (optimal efficiency)
   - Frontend receives familiar peso values
   - 100x performance improvement over frontend conversion

3. **Penalty Calculation:** Unit-scoped optimization
   - Skip paid bills for efficiency
   - Target <100ms vs 2000ms full recalculation
   - Integration with surgical updates

4. **Data Consistency:** Strong consistency model
   - No temporary inconsistencies
   - What's on screen = what's in database
   - aggregatedData is rebuildable cache

5. **Testing Strategy:** Backend API testing focus
   - Use testHarness for verification
   - Minimal UI testing required
   - Fresh AVII data for each phase

## üìã Issues Being Fixed

### Issue 0 (ROOT CAUSE - ‚úÖ RESOLVED):
Floating point precision errors ($914.3000000001 instead of $914.30)

### Issue 1 (üî• HIGH - ‚úÖ RESOLVED):
Backend currency storage inconsistency (mix of centavos and pesos)

### Issue 2 (üî• HIGH - ‚úÖ RESOLVED):
API architecture inefficiency (frontend doing manual calculations)

### Issue 3 (üö® CRITICAL - üîÑ IN PROGRESS):
Penalty calculation over-processing (all units instead of affected units)

### Issue 4 (üü° MEDIUM - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Surgical update verification (ensure all touchpoints updated)

### Issue 5 (üî• HIGH - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Delete transaction credit balance restoration

### Issue 6 (üî• HIGH - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Delete transaction bill status reversal

### Issue 7 (üü° MEDIUM - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Import routine due date logic (set to bill month, not import date)
