## 🔧 Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture:
1. **Credit Balance Endpoint:** New `/credit` REST API (Task 0A)
   - Points to current HOA Dues location initially
   - Future migration path built-in
   - Clean module separation

2. **Penalty Calculation:** Added to existing nightly routine
   - NOT a new cron job
   - Included in surgical updates
   - Grace period: 10 days after due date

3. **Surgical Updates:** Same code for bulk and single unit
   - Bulk: Array of all units
   - Surgical: Array of 1 unit
   - Atomic operations only

4. **Data Consistency:** Strong consistency model
   - No temporary inconsistencies
   - What's on screen = what's in database
   - aggregatedData is rebuildable cache

5. **Testing Strategy:** 90% backend API testing
   - Use testHarness
   - Minimal UI testing
   - Fresh AVII data for each phase

## 📋 Issues Being Fixed

### Issue 0 (ROOT CAUSE - 🚨 CRITICAL):
Penalties not being calculated ($0 for all units)

### Issue 1 (🔥 HIGH):
Credit balance not updating until reload

### Issue 2 (🔥 HIGH):
Paid bill amounts not cleared in UI

### Issue 3 (🚨 CRITICAL):
Due amount shows after refresh/recalc

### Issue 4 (🟡 MEDIUM):
"NOBILL" error blocks overdue payments

### Issue 5 (🔥 HIGH):
Delete doesn't restore credit balance

### Issue 6 (🔥 HIGH):
Delete doesn't mark bills unpaid

### Issue 7 (🟡 MEDIUM):
lastPenaltyUpdate not updating after delete

---

## 🎯 Implementation Roadmap

### Priority Order:
1. **Task 1:** Fix penalties (root cause)
2. **Task 2:** Fix payments (depends on penalties)
3. **Task 3:** Fix deletions (depends on payments)

### All-or-Nothing Merge:
Single feature branch for all fixes. Merge only when complete and tested.
