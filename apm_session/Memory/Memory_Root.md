# SAMS Project Memory Root

## üéØ Current Status: Water Bills Critical Fixes - WB2 In Progress

**Active Feature Branch:** `feature/water-bills-issues-0-7-complete-fix`

### ‚úÖ Completed (October 16-17, 2025):
1. **WB1: Backend Data Structure + Floating Point Storage** ‚úÖ
   - Converted entire Water Bills backend from floating point pesos to integer centavos
   - Eliminated floating point precision bug ($914.3000000001 ‚Üí $914.30)
   - Added API compatibility layer (backend stores centavos, API sends pesos)
   - Enhanced aggregatedData with new fields (totalUnpaidAmount, totalPenalties, etc.)
   - Performance: 100x efficiency improvement validated

2. **WB1A: Architecture Validation** ‚úÖ
   - Comprehensive analysis of all 4 API endpoints
   - Confirmed 100% pesos delivery to frontend
   - Validated optimal architecture decision
   - Production readiness confirmed

3. **WB2: Penalty Calc Optimization** ‚úÖ
   - Added unit scoping to penalty recalculation (surgical updates)
   - Implemented paid bills skipping for efficiency
   - **Performance: 6x-9x speedup achieved** (2000-3000ms ‚Üí 319ms)
   - 83.3% reduction in bills processed
   - Backward compatible, tested with real AVII data
   - Integration with surgical updates and delete reversals complete

4. **WB1B: Frontend Use Pre-Calculated Values** ‚úÖ
   - Removed fallback calculations for displayDue, displayPenalties, displayOverdue
   - Frontend now trusts backend pre-calculated values
   - Code simplified with clear comments
   - **Discovered:** Backend displayDue calculation bug (WB1B-Followup created)
   - **Bonus:** Documented 4 areas where backend doesn't provide pre-calculated values

5. **WB5: Import Due Dates + Centavos** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed due date calculation (bill month day 10, not import date + 10)
   - Implemented currency conversion (pesos ‚Üí centavos during import)
   - Backward compatible with optional parameters
   - 4/4 test suites passing (100%)
   - Production ready for historical data re-import

### ‚è≥ Pending:
- **WB1B-Followup: Fix displayDue Calculation Bug** (HIGH - 1 hour)
  - Backend displayDue missing overdue + penalties
  - Unit 105 shows $1.00, should show $202.50
  - Simple fix in waterDataService.js
- **WB3: Surgical Update Full Verification** (map touchpoints + test)
- **WB4: Delete Transaction Analysis & Fix** (credit history + all touchpoints)

## üìä Project Overview

### What We're Fixing:
**Water Bills Module** - Critical architecture and performance issues

### Why It Matters:
Water Bills is the **reference implementation** for HOA Dues and future modules. The backend architecture (centavos storage + API conversion) will be the standard for all financial modules.

### Timeline:
- **WB1 (Backend Architecture):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB1A (Architecture Validation):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB2 (Penalty Optimization):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB1B (Frontend Pre-Calculated Values):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB5 (Import Due Dates + Centavos):** Complete ‚úÖ
- **WB1B-Followup (Fix displayDue Bug):** Pending ‚è≥ (HIGH - 1 hr)
- **WB3-WB4:** 4-6 hours remaining
- **Target:** Complete Water Bills "rock solid" foundation

## üîß Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture:
1. **Backend Currency Storage:** All amounts stored as integer centavos
   - Eliminates floating point precision errors
   - Exact financial calculations
   - Consistent with HOA Dues and Transactions modules

2. **API Conversion Layer:** Backend centavos ‚Üí API pesos
   - Single conversion per request (optimal efficiency)
   - Frontend receives familiar peso values
   - 100x performance improvement over frontend conversion

3. **Penalty Calculation:** Unit-scoped optimization
   - Skip paid bills for efficiency
   - Target <100ms vs 2000ms full recalculation
   - Integration with surgical updates

4. **Data Consistency:** Strong consistency model
   - No temporary inconsistencies
   - What's on screen = what's in database
   - aggregatedData is rebuildable cache

5. **Testing Strategy:** Backend API testing focus
   - Use testHarness for verification
   - Minimal UI testing required
   - Fresh AVII data for each phase

## üìã Issues Being Fixed

### Issue 0 (ROOT CAUSE - ‚úÖ RESOLVED):
Floating point precision errors ($914.3000000001 instead of $914.30)

### Issue 1 (üî• HIGH - ‚úÖ RESOLVED):
Backend currency storage inconsistency (mix of centavos and pesos)

### Issue 2 (üî• HIGH - ‚úÖ RESOLVED):
API architecture inefficiency (frontend doing manual calculations)

### Issue 3 (üö® CRITICAL - üîÑ IN PROGRESS):
Penalty calculation over-processing (all units instead of affected units)

### Issue 4 (üü° MEDIUM - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Surgical update verification (ensure all touchpoints updated)

### Issue 5 (üî• HIGH - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Delete transaction credit balance restoration

### Issue 6 (üî• HIGH - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Delete transaction bill status reversal

### Issue 7 (üü° MEDIUM - ‚è≥ PENDING):
Import routine due date logic (set to bill month, not import date)
