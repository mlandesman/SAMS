**Project:** Sandyland Association Management System (SAMS)
**Status:** Production Active - v0.0.11 Deployed

## Session History

### Session: Manager Agent - Water Bills Performance Optimization (October 13, 2025)
**Focus:** Water Bills Cache Architecture and Performance Optimization (Issues #22 + #11)
- **Achievement**: 93% API call reduction (14 → 1 per render cycle), near instant load times
- **Implementation**: Agent_Water_Performance delivered React Context with dual-layer caching
- **Scope Clarity**: Phase 1 (cache architecture) complete, Phase 2 (surgical updates) deferred
- **Quality**: Fully Approved review with comprehensive pattern documentation
- **Performance**: Normal load near instant, tab switches 0 additional API calls, dashboard optimized
- **Documentation**: Created reusable CENTRALIZED_DATA_MANAGEMENT_PATTERN.md for future systems

**Task Completed:**
✅ **Agent_Water_Performance** - Water Bills Aggregated Data Architecture (8 files modified, 1 doc created)
   - Implemented React Context for centralized data management
   - Added request deduplication to prevent concurrent API calls
   - Refactored 3 major components (WaterReadingEntry, WaterHistoryGrid, WaterBillsList)
   - Created manual refresh flow with Sandyland branded spinner
   - Backend pre-calculates monthly summaries with overdueDetails
   - Cache invalidation clears both aggregatedData document AND timestamp
   - Files: WaterBillsContext.jsx, 3 components, WaterBillsViewV3.jsx, waterAPI.js, waterDataService.js, waterRoutes.js

**Technical Achievements:**
- Cache Architecture: Dual-layer (sessionStorage + Firestore timestamp validation)
- Performance: Near instant initial load, 0 API calls on tab switches
- Dashboard: Single lightweight call using pre-calculated summary
- Manual Refresh: ~10 seconds for full year rebuild (acceptable for future nightly cloud function)
- Pattern Documentation: Reusable guide for HOA Dues and future billing systems

**Clarifications from Product Manager:**
- 10s rebuild time is acceptable (for manual refresh or nightly cloud function)
- Normal load performance is near instant (reading pre-aggregated data)
- Performance issue was excessive cache checks (14x), not rebuild time
- Surgical updates properly scoped to Phase 2 (separate future task)

**Process Achievements:**
- Manager Agent pushed back constructively on initial unclear scope
- Product Manager clarified Phase 1 vs Phase 2 separation
- Collaborative dialogue ensured proper understanding before approval
- Auto-archiving triggered: task moved to Completed/, tracking docs updated

**GitHub Issues Closed:** #22 (Cache Invalidation), #11 (Performance Optimization)
**Priority Completed:** Priority 0 - Water Bills Performance Optimization
**Review Document:** `/Memory/Reviews/Manager_Review_Water_Bills_Performance_Optimization_2025-10-13.md`

**Next Priority:** Priority 3a - Water Bills Split Transactions (fresh implementation against current main)

### Session: Manager Agent - Testing Blockers Resolution (October 12, 2025)
**Focus:** Resolution of All Testing Blockers (GitHub Issue #15)
- **Achievement**: 100% resolution rate - all 3 testing blockers fixed, tested, and deployed
- **Implementation**: Coordinated 3 Implementation Agents on 3 separate tasks with independent branches
- **Quality**: All 3 tasks received "Fully Approved" Manager reviews
- **Testing**: 100% user verification rate - all fixes confirmed working in Dev environment
- **Deployment**: Version v0.0.11 deployed to production with all fixes
- **Documentation**: 2000+ lines created (3 Memory Logs, 3 Manager Reviews, 1 Technical Doc, 1 Test Suite)

**Tasks Completed:**
1. ✅ **Agent_Import** - Payment Methods Import Status Field (4 files, commit c92a27c)
   - Fixed import process to set `status: "active"` for all payment methods
   - Prevents empty dropdown issue for future client imports
   - Branch: `fix/payment-methods-import-status`
   
2. ✅ **Agent_Expense_Filter** - Expense Entry Modal Active Filter (1 file, PR #18)
   - Added filtering to show only active payment methods
   - Achieved UX consistency across transaction entry points
   - Branch: `fix/expense-modal-filter-payment-methods`
   
3. ✅ **Agent_DocumentUpload** - Document Upload 500 Error Fix (1 file + tests + docs, PR #19)
   - Fixed Firebase Cloud Functions storage bucket initialization
   - Restored document upload functionality after Vercel→Firebase migration
   - Created comprehensive test suite (235 lines)
   - Branch: `fix/document-upload-500-error`

**Technical Findings:**
- Discovered TD-017: 1st Gen Cloud Function needs migration (low priority, documented)
- Created test infrastructure for document uploads (prevents regression)
- Identified migration testing gaps (documented prevention guidelines)

**Process Achievements:**
- Clean git workflow: 3 independent branches, 2 PRs, professional commits
- Comprehensive documentation: Each task fully documented with Memory Logs and reviews
- Auto-archiving: Resolved issues moved to resolved/ folder automatically
- GitHub integration: Issue #15 closed with comprehensive completion summary

**Version Deployed:** v0.0.11 (patch release)
- Status: ✅ Production deployment successful
- Duration: ~6 hours Manager Agent session

### Session: Manager Agent - Document Consolidation (October 9, 2025)
**Focus:** Comprehensive Document Consolidation and Priority Workshop Preparation
- Archived obsolete tracking documents (TECHNICAL_DEBT.md, Tasks Order.rtf)
- Created comprehensive priority workshop with complete work inventory
- Scanned all non-archived Memory documents for recent work and technical debt
- Confirmed 8 major completions (Sept-Oct 2025): Credit Balance, Transaction ID, Import/Purge, Water Bills, etc.
- Confirmed Priority 1 (Credit Balance) and Priority 2 (Water Bills) COMPLETE
- Identified Statement of Account Report as high priority missing from plans
- Resolved TD-NEW-001 (Year-End Balance Import) and TD-NEW-002 (Import CrossRef)
- Created handover document for collaborative priority workshop (Option B)
- Status: ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2 (Collaborative Workshop)

### Session: Manager Agent (October 7, 2025)
**Focus:** Transaction ID Date Generation Bug Analysis and Fix
- Completed deep analysis of persistent Transaction ID date regression
- Bug: Transaction IDs generated one day earlier than selected date
- Root cause: Date components extracted in local timezone instead of Cancun
- Solution: Use original date string directly, avoiding timezone conversions
- Implementation: Modified transactionsController.js to preserve date string
- Testing note: User was testing on production instead of dev environment
- Status: ✅ FIXED - Commit ab24b8d
