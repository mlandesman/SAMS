# Archive Log - September 28, 2025

## Archival Policy Update
Per Michael's directive: ALL files that could confuse future agents (task assignments, reviews, implementation handovers) should be moved to archive directories after successful completion. Only reference materials (usage notes, decisions, technical debt logs) should remain accessible.
