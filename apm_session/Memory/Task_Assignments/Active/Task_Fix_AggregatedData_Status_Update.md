# Task Assignment: Fix AggregatedData Status Update

**Task ID:** WB-Fix-AggregatedData-Status  
**Agent:** Implementation_Agent_Fix  
**Priority:** 🚨 CRITICAL  
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 hours  
**Created:** October 16, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/water-bills-issues-0-7-complete-fix`

---

## 🎯 Mission

Fix the surgical update logic so that aggregatedData status field gets properly updated from "unpaid" to "paid" after payments are made. Currently, bill documents show correct status but aggregatedData remains stale.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### The Issue
**Payment cascade:** ✅ Working perfectly  
**Bill documents:** ✅ Updated correctly (`status: "paid"`)  
**Surgical update:** ❌ Not updating aggregatedData status field  
**UI display:** ❌ Shows "UNPAID" because it reads from aggregatedData  

### Evidence
**From Michael's testing:**
- Unit 103 bills: All marked as `"paidAmount": 150, "status": "paid"` in Firestore
- AggregatedData: Still shows `"status": "unpaid"` for Unit 103
- UI: Shows "UNPAID" button instead of "PAID"
- Full refresh: Doesn't fix the status field

**From console logs:**
```
⚡ [SURGICAL] Using existing unit data, fetching only updated bill
✅ [SURGICAL_UPDATE] Updated unit 103 in month 3
```
Surgical update claims success but status field doesn't change.

## 🔍 Investigation Requirements

### Phase 1: Trace Surgical Update Logic

**File:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js`  
**Function:** `updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()` (lines ~515-620)  
**Function:** `buildSingleUnitData()` (fast path, lines ~186-208)

**Investigate:**
1. **What does surgical update actually write?**
   - Log the exact data being written to aggregatedData
   - Compare before/after aggregatedData documents
   - Verify field paths are correct

2. **Is status field being calculated correctly?**
   - Check `calculateStatus()` function logic
   - Verify it reads from updated bill document
   - Ensure it returns "paid" when bill is paid

3. **Is the write operation succeeding?**
   - Check if Firestore write is actually happening
   - Verify no errors in the write operation
   - Check if write is being overwritten immediately

### Phase 2: Compare with Working System

**Reference:** Manual refresh works correctly
**Function:** `buildYearData()` (lines ~350-400)

**Compare:**
1. **How does manual refresh calculate status?**
2. **What's different between surgical update and full rebuild?**
3. **Does full rebuild properly update status fields?**

## 📋 Specific Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Status Field Update in Surgical Update

**Location:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js` - `buildSingleUnitData()` fast path

**Current Logic (lines 186-208):**
```javascript
if (existingUnitData) {
  // Fast path - reuse existing data
  return {
    ...existingUnitData,  // ← SPREADS OLD STATUS
    paidAmount: bill.paidAmount || 0,
    unpaidAmount: bill.totalAmount - (bill.paidAmount || 0),
    status: this.calculateStatus(bill),  // ← SHOULD UPDATE STATUS
    // ...
  };
}
```

**Problem:** Status might not be getting calculated correctly or written properly.

**Required:** Verify `calculateStatus(bill)` returns "paid" when bill is paid, and ensure it gets written to aggregatedData.

### Fix 2: Verify Status Calculation Logic

**Function:** `calculateStatus()` (likely in same file)

**Check:**
```javascript
calculateStatus(bill) {
  if (bill.paidAmount >= bill.totalAmount) {
    return 'paid';
  } else if (bill.paidAmount > 0) {
    return 'partial';
  } else {
    return 'unpaid';
  }
}
```

**Verify:** This logic matches the bill document data structure and returns correct status.

### Fix 3: Ensure Write Operation Completes

**Location:** Surgical update write operation

**Check:**
1. Firestore write is actually executed
2. No errors in write operation
3. Write isn't being overwritten by another operation
4. Field paths are correct (`months[M].units[unitId].status`)

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test Scenario (Use Michael's Data)
**Unit:** 103 (already has paid bills)  
**Expected Result:** Status should be "paid" in aggregatedData  
**Test Steps:**
1. Read current aggregatedData for Unit 103
2. Trigger surgical update (make small change to trigger update)
3. Read aggregatedData again
4. Verify status field changed from "unpaid" to "paid"

### Alternative Test (Create New Scenario)
**Setup:**
1. Create test unit with unpaid bill
2. Make payment through UI
3. Check aggregatedData status updates correctly

---

## 📤 Deliverables

### 1. Fixed Code
**Files to modify:**
- `backend/services/waterDataService.js` (surgical update logic)
- Any helper functions for status calculation

### 2. Test Results
**File:** `backend/testing/testAggregatedDataStatusFix.js`

**Must verify:**
- Surgical update correctly updates status field
- UI shows "PAID" after payment
- Full refresh also works correctly
- No regression in payment processing

### 3. Documentation
**File:** `apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/Fix_AggregatedData_Status_Update_2025-10-16.md`

**Must include:**
- Root cause analysis
- Code changes made
- Test results
- Verification that UI now shows correct status

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**This task is complete when:**
1. ✅ Unit 103 shows "PAID" status in UI after payment
2. ✅ AggregatedData status field matches bill document status
3. ✅ Surgical update properly updates status field
4. ✅ Full refresh also updates status correctly
5. ✅ No regression in payment processing functionality

## 📚 Key Files

### Primary
- `backend/services/waterDataService.js`
  - `updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()` - Surgical update entry point
  - `buildSingleUnitData()` - Unit data calculation (fast path)
  - `calculateStatus()` - Status calculation logic

### Reference
- `backend/services/waterPaymentsService.js` - Payment cascade (working correctly)
- Firestore documents: `clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/2026-03` (bill data)
- Firestore documents: `clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/aggregatedData` (UI data)

---

## 💡 Hints

### Debugging Strategy
1. **Add detailed logging** to surgical update write operation
2. **Compare before/after** aggregatedData documents
3. **Test with Michael's Unit 103** data (known working payment, broken status)
4. **Verify field paths** match what UI expects to read

### Common Issues
- Status calculation logic incorrect
- Field path mismatch in write operation
- Write operation not completing
- Race condition with other operations

---

**Remember:** The payment cascade is working perfectly. This is purely a UI data synchronization issue between bill documents and aggregatedData.
