# Task Assignment: Priority 1B - Water Bills Cascade Delete Enhancement

## Objective
Add surgical penalty recalculation trigger to existing Water Bills cascade delete logic when transactions are deleted. This ensures bills return to unpaid status AND penalties are recalculated surgically.

## Critical Context

### Production Blocker Status
**Cannot deploy Priority 1 without this fix.**

Currently when a Water Bills payment is deleted:
- ‚úÖ Bills marked as unpaid (working)
- ‚úÖ Payment amounts reversed (working)
- ‚úÖ Credit balances reversed (working)
- ‚ùå **Penalties NOT recalculated** (MISSING - production blocker)

**Impact:** Deleting payments leaves incorrect penalty data, corrupting Water Bills integrity.

---

## Good News: Most Code Already Exists!

### What's Already Complete

**1. Water Bills Cascade Delete Function Exists**
- **File:** `backend/controllers/transactionsController.js`
- **Function:** `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()` (lines 1180-1277)
- **Does:** Reverses payments, updates bill status, clears lastPayment, reverses credit

**2. Surgical Penalty Recalculation Exists**
- **File:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js`
- **Function:** `updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()`
- **Does:** Surgically recalculates penalties for specific unit (under 1 second with cache invalidation)
- **Completed:** October 13-14, 2025 (Water Bills Surgical Updates)

**3. HOA Dues Pattern Complete**
- **File:** `backend/controllers/transactionsController.js`
- **Function:** `executeHOADuesCleanupWrite()` (lines 1003-1177)
- **Pattern:** Shows exactly how to handle cascade deletes with credit balance

## What Needs to Be Added

### The Missing Piece: Surgical Recalc Trigger

After reversing Water Bills payments in `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()`, need to trigger surgical penalty recalculation:

**Pseudocode:**
```javascript
// At end of executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite() - after line 1276
// Trigger surgical penalty recalculation for affected unit
const waterDataService = require('../services/waterDataService');
const fiscalYear = getNow().getFullYear(); // Or extract from bill year

// Build list of affected months
const affectedMonths = waterBillDocs.map(doc => ({
  unitId: originalData.unitId,
  month: extractMonthFromBillId(doc.id) // Need to parse bill ID like "2026-03"
}));

// Trigger surgical update (existing function from Oct 13-14 work)
await waterDataService.updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment(
  clientId, 
  fiscalYear, 
  affectedMonths
);

console.log(`üîÑ [BACKEND] Surgically recalculated penalties for ${affectedMonths.length} months`);
```

**That's it!** The surgical recalc function exists and works perfectly. Just need to call it.

---

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis (1-2 hours)

#### Step 1.1: Study HOA Dues Cascade Delete
- **File:** `backend/controllers/transactionsController.js`
- **Function:** `executeHOADuesCleanupWrite()` (lines 1003-1177)
- **Focus:**
  - How does it identify months to reverse?
  - How does it handle credit balance history?
  - How does it work within Firestore transaction?
  - What data structures are updated?

#### Step 1.2: Review Existing Water Bills Cleanup
- **File:** `backend/controllers/transactionsController.js`
- **Function:** `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()` (lines 1180-1277)
- **Document:**
  - What it currently does
  - What it's missing
  - Where surgical recalc trigger should go
  - How to extract affected months from bill documents

#### Step 1.3: Review Surgical Update Function
- **File:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js`
- **Function:** `updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment()`
- **Understand:**
  - Parameters required (clientId, fiscalYear, affectedMonths array)
  - What it does (surgical penalty recalc + cache invalidation)
  - Performance characteristics (under 1 second)

#### Step 1.4: Design Integration
- **Document:**
  - Where to add surgical recalc call
  - How to build affectedMonths array
  - Error handling approach
  - Testing strategy

**Deliverable:** Analysis document showing HOA pattern, Water Bills current state, and design for enhancement

---

### Phase 2: Implementation (2 hours)

#### Step 2.1: Extract Month from Bill ID
Create helper function to parse bill IDs like "2026-03" to extract month number:
```javascript
function extractMonthFromBillId(billId) {
  // billId format: "YYYY-MM" (e.g., "2026-03")
  const parts = billId.split('-');
  return parseInt(parts[1], 10); // Returns month number (0-11)
}
```

#### Step 2.2: Build Affected Months Array
After reversing bills, build array of affected units/months:
```javascript
const affectedMonths = waterBillDocs.map(billDoc => ({
  unitId: originalData.unitId,
  month: extractMonthFromBillId(billDoc.id)
}));
```

#### Step 2.3: Add Surgical Recalc Trigger
At end of `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()` (after line 1276):
```javascript
// Trigger surgical penalty recalculation for affected unit
// This ensures penalties are recalculated after payment reversal
try {
  const waterDataService = require('../services/waterDataService');
  const fiscalYear = getNow().getFullYear(); // Or extract from bill year
  
  await waterDataService.updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment(
    clientId, 
    fiscalYear, 
    affectedMonths
  );
  
  console.log(`üîÑ [BACKEND] Surgically recalculated penalties for ${affectedMonths.length} months after payment reversal`);
} catch (recalcError) {
  console.error('‚ùå [BACKEND] Error during surgical penalty recalculation:', recalcError);
  // Don't fail the delete - log error but continue
}
```

#### Step 2.4: Handle Async in Firestore Transaction
**Critical:** `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()` is called inside a Firestore transaction. Need to ensure async surgical update doesn't break transaction integrity.

**Options:**
1. Call surgical update AFTER Firestore transaction commits (recommended)
2. Make surgical update synchronous (not recommended)
3. Queue surgical update for post-commit execution

**Recommendation:** Option 1 - Move surgical recalc call outside Firestore transaction scope

---

### Phase 3: Testing (1 hour)

#### Test Case 1: Delete Single Bill Payment with Penalty
1. Create payment for Unit 203 June bill: $2150 ($2000 base + $150 penalty)
2. Verify split transaction created with allocations
3. **Delete transaction via Transactions View**
4. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ Bill status returns to UNPAID
   - ‚úÖ paidAmount reset to 0
   - ‚úÖ Penalty recalculated surgically (check aggregatedData)
   - ‚úÖ Credit balance unchanged (no credit involved)

#### Test Case 2: Delete Payment with Credit Usage
1. Create payment using credit balance
2. Verify credit balance reduced
3. **Delete transaction**
4. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ Bill returned to unpaid
   - ‚úÖ Credit balance restored
   - ‚úÖ Penalties recalculated

#### Test Case 3: Delete Multiple Bills Payment
1. Create payment for multiple bills (June + July)
2. **Delete transaction**
3. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ Both bills returned to unpaid
   - ‚úÖ Both months recalculated surgically
   - ‚úÖ aggregatedData updated correctly

#### Test Case 4: Surgical Update Performance
- Verify deletion + recalc completes in under 2 seconds
- Check console logs for surgical update confirmation
- Verify cache invalidation triggers UI refresh

## Reference Implementation

### HOA Dues Cascade Delete Pattern
**File:** `backend/controllers/transactionsController.js`
- **Call site:** Lines 838-862 (within deleteTransaction)
- **Implementation:** `executeHOADuesCleanupWrite()` lines 1003-1177
- **Key patterns:**
  - Credit balance history analysis
  - Payment array clearing
  - Credit balance reversal calculation

### Surgical Update Function (Already Complete)
**File:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js`
- **Function:** `updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment(clientId, fiscalYear, affectedUnitsAndMonths)`
- **Performance:** 503-728ms for surgical update (94% faster than full recalc)
- **Usage:** Called after payments with unitId parameter

---

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Constraints

1. **Firestore Transaction Scope**
   - `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()` runs inside Firestore transaction
   - Surgical penalty recalc is async and touches multiple documents
   - **Solution:** Call surgical update AFTER Firestore transaction commits

2. **Surgical Update Already Proven**
   - Function exists and works (October 13-14 completion)
   - Handles cache invalidation automatically
   - Completes in under 1 second
   - **Just need to call it with correct parameters**

3. **Credit Balance Integration**
   - Water Bills uses HOA credit balance system
   - Reversal already handled through HOA controller
   - No additional credit logic needed

### Testing with Real Data

**Available AVII Test Data:**
- Multiple test payments created during Priority 1 testing
- Real penalties calculated
- Credit balance scenarios
- **All need to be deleted to clean up test data**

**This task serves dual purpose:**
1. Implement missing cascade delete
2. Clean up test data from Priority 1

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ Deleting Water Bills payment returns bills to unpaid status
- ‚úÖ Payment amounts fully reversed (paidAmount, basePaid, penaltyPaid)
- ‚úÖ Credit balance changes reversed (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ **Penalties recalculated surgically for affected unit**
- ‚úÖ aggregatedData updated with correct penalty amounts
- ‚úÖ Cache invalidated to trigger UI refresh

### Technical Requirements
- ‚úÖ Follows HOA Dues cascade delete pattern
- ‚úÖ Uses existing surgical update function
- ‚úÖ Completes in under 2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple bill deletions
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

### Testing Requirements

## Deliverables

1. **Analysis Document** - HOA pattern review and Water Bills design
2. **Enhanced `executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite()`** - With surgical recalc trigger
3. **Testing Results** - All test cases passed
4. **Cleanup Confirmation** - Priority 1 test payments deleted successfully
5. **Memory Log** - Complete documentation

## Manager Agent Review Criteria

When reviewing completion:
- [ ] Surgical penalty recalc triggered after payment reversal
- [ ] Bills returned to correct status (unpaid/partial)
- [ ] Credit balances reversed properly
- [ ] aggregatedData updated with recalculated penalties
- [ ] All test payments from Priority 1 successfully deleted
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Performance acceptable (under 2 seconds)

**Success Definition:** Can delete any Water Bills payment and have complete data reversal including surgical penalty recalculation, enabling production deployment.

---

**Manager Agent Approval:** This task is READY FOR ASSIGNMENT as Priority 1B (Production Blocker). The good news is that most code exists - just need to add the surgical recalc trigger using the proven function from October 13-14 work.

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours (Analysis: 1-2, Implementation: 1-2, Testing: 1)  
**Priority:** üö® CRITICAL - Blocks production deployment
