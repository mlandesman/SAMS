# /newIA Assignment: Task 3 - Delete Reversal Implementation

## 🎯 Your Mission

You are Implementation Agent assigned to **complete the delete reversal function** for Water Bills. Currently it's 70% incomplete - only 52 lines vs HOA Dues' 175 lines. Your job is to **copy the working HOA Dues pattern** and adapt it for Water Bills.

---

## 📖 Critical Context

### The Problems:
1. **Issue 5:** Delete doesn't restore credit balance (money "lost")
2. **Issue 6:** Delete doesn't mark bills unpaid (incorrect status)
3. **Issue 7:** lastPenaltyUpdate not updating after delete (stale data)

### Investigation Finding:
> "Water Bills cleanup is 70% incomplete. HOA Dues pattern: 175 lines (complete with credit reversal). Water Bills pattern: 52 lines (only bill updates, NO credit reversal). Missing: ~80 lines of credit balance reversal code."

### Your Fix:
Copy the complete, working HOA Dues pattern to Water Bills. It's proven code.

---

## 📋 CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Git Workflow (MANDATORY)
```bash
# FIRST - Verify you're on feature branch
git branch
# Must show: * feature/water-bills-issues-0-7-complete-fix

# Pull latest changes (Tasks 0A, 1, 2)
git pull

# If not on correct branch, STOP and ask for help
```

**Read:** `/docs/GIT_WORKFLOW_FOR_WATER_BILLS_FIX.md` before starting

### 2. Prerequisites Check
**Tasks 1 & 2 MUST be complete** before starting this task.

Verify:
```bash
# Check Task 1 Memory Log exists
ls apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/Task_1_Penalty_Calculation_Integration_2025-10-15.md

# Check Task 2 Memory Log exists  
ls apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/Task_2_Payment_Issues_Resolution_2025-10-15.md

# If either missing, wait for completion
```

### 3. Product Manager's Instructions
- **Copy exact pattern:** HOA Dues executeHOADuesCleanupWrite() → Water Bills
- **Use /credit endpoint:** From Task 0A (not direct HOA Dues access)
- **Surgical update:** Preferred over full recalc after delete
- **Testing focus:** 90% backend API testing

### 4. Complete Task Assignment
**Read this file COMPLETELY before coding:**
`apm_session/Memory/Task_Assignments/Active/Task_3_Delete_Reversal_Implementation.md`

It contains:
- HOA Dues pattern to copy
- Step-by-step implementation
- 5 comprehensive backend tests
- Success criteria

## 🔧 Implementation Checklist

### Setup
- [ ] Read complete task assignment document
- [ ] Read git workflow document
- [ ] Verify Tasks 1 & 2 complete
- [ ] Verify on feature branch
- [ ] Pull latest changes

### Analysis Phase
- [ ] Read HOA Dues pattern: `backend/services/transactions/transactionsCleanupService.js` (lines 161-335)
- [ ] Document current Water Bills cleanup (52 lines)
- [ ] Identify missing credit reversal code (~80 lines)

### Implementation Phase
- [ ] Copy credit reversal logic from HOA Dues
- [ ] Adapt for Water Bills-specific structure
- [ ] Integrate with `/credit` endpoint (Task 0A)
- [ ] Add surgical update trigger after delete
- [ ] Handle edge cases (partial payments, multiple payments)

### Testing Phase
- [ ] Test 1: Credit used gets restored
- [ ] Test 2: Credit created gets removed
- [ ] Test 3: Bills marked unpaid
- [ ] Test 4: Surgical update runs
- [ ] Test 5: Complete end-to-end reversal

### Completion
- [ ] Create Memory Log with before/after comparison
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

**Environment:** Dev with fresh AVII data  
**Method:** Backend API testing (testHarness) - **REQUIRED FOR AUTH**  
**Client:** AVII

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use testHarness for ALL API Calls
All endpoints require Firebase auth tokens. Direct calls (axios/fetch/curl) will fail with 401 errors.

```bash
cd backend
node testing/testHarness.js  # Provides authenticated access
```

### Required Tests (5):

#### Test 1: Credit Used in Payment Gets Restored
```javascript
// Make payment using $100 credit
// Delete transaction
// Expected: Credit balance +$100 (restored)
```

#### Test 2: Overpayment Credit Gets Removed
```javascript
// Pay $500 on $400 bill (creates $100 credit)
// Delete transaction
// Expected: Credit balance -$100 (removed)
```

#### Test 3: Bills Marked Unpaid After Delete
```javascript
// Pay 2 bills → status: "paid"
// Delete transaction
// Expected: Both bills status: "unpaid"
```

#### Test 4: Surgical Update After Delete
```javascript
// Delete transaction
// Expected: lastPenaltyUpdate timestamp updated
// Expected: aggregatedData reflects unpaid status
```

#### Test 5: Complete End-to-End Reversal
```javascript
// Complex payment: use credit, pay multiple bills, create overpayment
// Delete transaction
// Expected: ALL changes reversed (credit, bills, aggregatedData)
```

**Hard Stop:** All 5 tests must pass before declaring success

## 📝 Memory Log

**File:** `apm_session/Memory/Task_Completion_Logs/Task_3_Delete_Reversal_Implementation_2025-10-15.md`

**Must include:**
- Before: 52 lines (incomplete)
- After: ~175 lines (complete)
- What was added (credit reversal, history, surgical update)
- All 5 test results with evidence
- No regressions confirmed

---

## 🚨 Critical Constraints

1. **COPY HOA Dues pattern** - Don't reinvent, use proven code
2. **MUST use /credit endpoint** - Not direct Firestore access
3. **DO NOT commit to main** - Stay on feature branch
4. **DO NOT skip testing** - All 5 tests required
5. **DO NOT claim success without evidence** - Full reversal must be verified

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Current (BROKEN):
```javascript
// Water Bills cleanup (52 lines)
async executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite(clientId, transactionId, transactionData) {
  // Delete transaction ✓
  // Update bills ✓
  // Restore credit ✗ MISSING
  // Update history ✗ MISSING
  // Surgical update ✗ MISSING
}
```

### After Your Fix (COMPLETE):
```javascript
// Water Bills cleanup (~175 lines)
async executeWaterBillsCleanupWrite(clientId, transactionId, transactionData) {
  // Delete transaction ✓
  // Update bills ✓
  // Restore credit ✓ ADDED
  // Update credit history ✓ ADDED
  // Surgical update ✓ ADDED
  // Handle edge cases ✓ ADDED
}
```

### Test Results:
**Before:**
- Delete payment → Credit: $50 (should be $150) ✗
- Delete payment → Bill status: "paid" (should be "unpaid") ✗

**After:**
- Delete payment → Credit: $150 ✓
- Delete payment → Bill status: "unpaid" ✓

## 📞 Support

**If stuck:**
- Review HOA Dues pattern: Lines 161-335 in `transactionsCleanupService.js`
- Check comparison: `docs/investigations/Phase_3_HOA_Dues_Pattern_Comparison.md`
- Review gap analysis: `docs/investigations/Phase_3_Delete_Gap_Analysis.md`
- Ask Manager Agent for clarification

**Key Reference Files:**

- Task 0A credit endpoint: `backend/services/creditService.js`

## 💡 Implementation Hint

The HOA Dues pattern has 4 main sections you need to copy:

1. **Credit Reversal Logic** (~80 lines)
   - Check if credit was used
   - Check if credit was created
   - Reverse appropriately using /credit endpoint

2. **Credit History Updates** (~20 lines)
   - Add reversal entry to credit history
   - Document what was reversed and why

3. **Enhanced Bill Updates** (~15 lines)
   - Restore penalties if paid
   - Remove payment from payments array
   - Recalculate status (unpaid/partial)

4. **Surgical Update Trigger** (~8 lines)
   - Call updateAggregatedDataAfterPayment (same as payment does)
   - Update only affected units

**Total addition: ~123 lines of proven, working code**

---

**Duration:** Estimated 2-3 hours (mostly copy/adapt)  
**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH - Financial data integrity  
**Prerequisite:** Tasks 1 & 2 complete  
**Status:** Ready for assignment (after Tasks 1 & 2)
