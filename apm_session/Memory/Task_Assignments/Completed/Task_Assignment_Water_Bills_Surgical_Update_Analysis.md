# Ad-hoc Analysis Task - Water Bills Surgical Update Architecture

## Context

We recently completed Phase 1 of Water Bills Performance Optimization (Issues #22 + #11), which implemented a cache architecture with React Context and pre-aggregated data. This reduced API calls by 93% and achieved near-instant normal load times.

**Phase 1 Accomplishments:**
- Dual-layer caching (sessionStorage + Firestore)
- Pre-aggregated data with backend calculation
- Manual refresh with full year rebuild (~10 seconds)
- React Context for centralized data management

**Phase 2 Goal:**
Implement "surgical updates" that recalculate and update cache data for a **single unit** after an individual water bill payment, without requiring the full 10-second rebuild.

---

## Task Objective

**Document and analyze** the current full recalculation process to determine the optimal implementation strategy for surgical updates after individual payments.

**This is an ANALYSIS task only** - no code implementation. Your deliverable is a technical report with recommendations that the Product Manager will review before authorizing any implementation work.

---

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Document Current Full Recalculation Process

**Primary Focus:** `backend/services/waterDataService.js`

Examine and document:
- `getYearData()` method - How does it orchestrate the full rebuild?
- `calculateYearSummary()` method - What calculations happen?
- Unit-by-unit processing - Is it recursive through all units as Product Manager suspects?
- Console logs during rebuild - What's the execution flow?
- Data structures - What gets calculated and stored?

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Does the recalc process iterate through units one at a time?
2. For each unit, what calculations are performed?
3. Are units independent (unit A doesn't affect unit B's calculations)?
4. What data is needed to recalculate a single unit?
5. What gets written to the aggregatedData Firestore document?

### 2. Identify Single-Unit Calculation Logic

**Goal:** Determine if we can extract/reuse existing logic for one unit

Document:
- Which functions/methods calculate data for a single unit?
- What inputs are required (readings, prior month data, config, etc.)?
- What outputs are produced (consumption, charges, penalties, carryover)?
- Are there any unit-to-unit dependencies that would break with surgical updates?

**Key Question:** Can we call the same calculation code with a single `unitId` parameter instead of looping through all units?

### 3. Analyze aggregatedData Document Structure

**File Location:** `clients/{clientId}/projects/waterBills/bills/aggregatedData`

Document:
- Current structure of the document (months, units, summary, etc.)
- How is data organized (nested by month? by unit? both?)
- Size/complexity of the document
- How updates would work (replace entire document? update specific paths?)

**Key Question:** Can we update just one unit's data in the document, or must we rewrite the entire thing?

### 4. Analyze sessionStorage Cache

**Cache Key:** `water_bills_{clientId}_{year}`

Document:
- Structure of cached data
- Size of cached data (affects update vs reload decision)
- How components consume the cached data
- Impact of reloading vs surgically updating

**Key Question:** Is it simpler/faster to reload the entire cache (~1-2 seconds) or surgically update one unit's data in memory?

### 5. Trace Payment Flow

**Starting Point:** Product Manager describes flow as:
> "enter payment modal data → post data to db → refresh the data surgically → display receipt modal"

Document:
- Where is the payment posted? (`waterPaymentsService.js`? Frontend? Backend controller?)
- What data changes when a payment is made? (transaction created, balance updated, etc.)
- Where would the surgical update call fit in this flow?
- Frontend or backend - where should surgical update logic live?

**Key Question:** What's the optimal integration point for calling the surgical update?

---

## Scope Constraints

### ✅ In Scope (Surgical Update For)
- **Individual water bill payments ONLY**
- Single unit, single payment at a time
- Narrow, predictable scope

### ❌ Out of Scope (Keep Full Recalc For)
- Saving Meter Readings month data (bulk operation - too complex)
- Generating Bills (bulk operation - too complex)
- Manual Refresh button (user-triggered full rebuild)
- Individual reading entries (no action until month save)

**Rationale:** Bulk operations affect too many units with unpredictable cascading effects. Surgical updates are ONLY for the narrow, predictable case of a single payment on a single unit.

---

## Analysis Approach

### Step 1: Code Reading (30-45 minutes)
- Read `backend/services/waterDataService.js` thoroughly
- Trace execution flow from `getYearData()` through calculations
- Identify unit-specific calculation functions
- Note any unit-to-unit dependencies

### Step 2: Console Log Analysis (15-30 minutes)
- Trigger a manual refresh in the UI (or use backend test script if available)
- Observe console logs to confirm unit-by-unit processing
- Document the actual execution sequence
- Note timing for full rebuild vs what single-unit might take

### Step 3: Data Structure Analysis (15-30 minutes)
- Examine aggregatedData document in Firestore (AVII client, current year)
- Examine sessionStorage cache structure (browser dev tools)
- Measure data sizes and complexity
- Determine update vs reload strategy

### Step 4: Integration Point Analysis (15-30 minutes)
- Trace payment flow from modal through backend
- Identify where surgical update should be called
- Determine frontend vs backend implementation approach
- Consider error handling and user feedback

---

## Constraints & Guidelines

### Do NOT Implement Code
- This is analysis only
- No code changes
- No new endpoints
- No refactoring
- Document what EXISTS, recommend what SHOULD exist

### Product Manager's Hypothesis
> "I am fairly certain based on the console logs that it just goes unit by unit recursively so we should be able to just call the same code without the recursion of all units."

**Your job:** Confirm or refute this hypothesis with evidence from code and logs.

### Cache Strategy Insight
> "The key will be updating the sessionStorage cache if we can without loading the entire thing again. If we have to load that is only a second or two so not terrible at all and maybe more efficient than trying to update the data in memory."

**Your job:** Analyze both options and provide recommendation with cost/benefit analysis.

### ES6 Modules Requirement
All backend code MUST use ES6 exports. If you recommend new code patterns, ensure they follow this constraint.

## Next Steps After This Task

**If analysis shows surgical updates are viable:**
→ Implementation Agent will be assigned to build the feature based on your recommendations

**If analysis reveals complexities:**
→ Product Manager will review risks and decide on approach adjustments

**Either way:**
→ Your analysis prevents wasted implementation effort on wrong approach
