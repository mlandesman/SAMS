# Task Assignment: Water Bills Code Recovery Investigation

## Objective
Investigate and identify why Water Bills code has reverted to an older version in Dev environment. Locate the "good" commits from ~24 hours ago and determine what caused the reversion.

## Context
- **Timeline:** Water Bills fixes were working ~24 hours ago, task was celebrated and closed
- **What Happened:** An agent did a hard reset that wiped the work, it was redone and committed again
- **Current Issue:** Code has reverted back to OLD version (works, but wrong code)
- **Suspected Cause:** Branch issue from iOS Cursor agents running in background
- **Scope:** Dev environment only (NOT a deployment issue)

## Task Breakdown

### Step 1: Identify Current State (15 min)
1. **Check current branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   git status
   ```

2. **Identify which version is currently active:**
   - Check these Water Bills files for indicators of OLD vs NEW code:
     - `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/WaterBills/WaterBills.jsx`
     - `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/WaterBills/WaterBillsHistory.jsx`
     - Any other Water Bills related components
   
3. **Known indicators of OLD code (missing features):**
   - Table formatting issues (not matching HOA Dues professional appearance)
   - Missing 12-month fiscal display
   - Consumption display problems
   - Auto-advance functionality missing for readings and bills

### Step 2: Find the "Good" Commits (30 min)
1. **Search Memory Logs for Water Bills task completion:**
   - Check `apm_session/Memory/` directories
   - Look for task logs mentioning "Water Bills" completion from past 7 days
   - Find commit hashes referenced in those logs

2. **Review Git history across ALL branches:**
   ```bash
   # See all branches
   git branch -a
   
   # Recent commits on current branch
   git log --oneline --graph -20
   
   # Recent commits across all branches
   git log --oneline --all --graph -30
   
   # Search for Water Bills related commits in past 7 days
   git log --all --grep="water" --grep="bills" -i --since="7 days ago" --oneline
   
   # Show commits with file changes in Water Bills directory
   git log --all --oneline --since="7 days ago" -- frontend/sams-ui/src/components/WaterBills/
   ```

3. **Identify the "good" commit(s):**
   - Note commit hash(es)
   - Note which branch they're on
   - Verify commit messages and dates align with ~24 hours ago

### Step 3: Determine What Happened (20 min)
1. **Compare current working directory to "good" commit:**
   ```bash
   # Once you find the good commit hash
   git diff <good-commit-hash> HEAD -- frontend/sams-ui/src/components/WaterBills/
   ```

2. **Check for uncommitted changes:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```

3. **Review reflog to see recent branch operations:**
   ```bash
   git reflog -20
   ```
   - Look for: checkouts, resets, merges from past 48 hours

### Step 4: Identify Root Cause (15 min)
**Determine which scenario occurred:**
- [ ] Good commits are on a different branch (not checked out)
- [ ] HEAD was moved backward to older commit
- [ ] A merge brought in older code from another branch
- [ ] Good commits were somehow lost (unlikely if committed)
- [ ] Other (describe)

### Step 5: Report Findings (20 min)
Create a comprehensive report including:

1. **Current State:**
   - Current branch: [name]
   - Current HEAD commit: [hash and message]
   - Which version of code is active: OLD or NEW
   - Specific missing features confirmed

2. **Good Commit Location:**
   - Commit hash(es): [hash]
   - Commit message(s): [message]
   - Branch location: [branch name]
   - Date/time: [timestamp]
   - Files changed: [list key files]

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - What happened: [describe the git operation that caused reversion]
   - When it happened: [timeframe based on reflog]
   - Why code reverted: [branch checkout, reset, merge, etc.]

4. **Recommended Fix:**
   - Specific git commands needed to restore good code
   - Any risks or considerations
   - Whether a simple merge/checkout will work

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Current state documented (branch, commit, version)
- [ ] "Good" commits located with hash and branch
- [ ] Root cause identified with evidence
- [ ] Recovery steps recommended with specific commands
- [ ] No assumptions - all findings backed by git log/reflog evidence

## Critical Guidelines
1. **DO NOT make any code changes or git operations** - INVESTIGATION ONLY
2. **DO NOT checkout branches or reset anything** - just gather information
3. **Document everything** - commit hashes, branch names, exact commands used
4. **If uncertain about findings** - report what you know and what's unclear

## Deliverable
**Memory Log:** Save findings to `/apm_session/Memory/Investigations/Water_Bills_Code_Recovery_Investigation_Log.md`

Include:
- All git commands run with their outputs
- Current state analysis
- Good commit identification with evidence
- Root cause determination
- Recommended recovery steps
- Any questions or uncertainties

## Questions Before Starting?
If anything is unclear about this investigation scope, ask Manager Agent for clarification before proceeding.

**Manager Agent Note:** This is a diagnostic task. Implementation Agent should gather evidence and report findings. Recovery actions will be decided after review of findings.
