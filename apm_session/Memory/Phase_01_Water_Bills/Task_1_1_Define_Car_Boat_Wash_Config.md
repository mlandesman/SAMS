# Task Log: Task 1.1 - Define Car/Boat Wash Configuration Fields

## Summary
Defined configuration fields `rateCarWash` and `rateBoatWash` for usage-based billing, following existing monetary patterns and creating complete Firebase implementation instructions.

## Details
- Analyzed existing waterbills configuration structure to understand monetary field patterns
- Identified that monetary values are stored as integers in centavos (not pesos)
- Updated field names to `rateCarWash` and `rateBoatWash` for consistent rate field sorting
- Documented exact placement within `/clients/{clientId}/config/waterBills` structure
- Created comprehensive Firebase console implementation guide
- Set default values: 10000 centavos (100 pesos) for car wash, 20000 centavos (200 pesos) for boat wash

## Output
- Created: `docs/waterbills/car-boat-wash-config-specification.md` 
- Field specifications: `rateCarWash` (integer, 10000 default), `rateBoatWash` (integer, 20000 default)
- Implementation location: `/clients/{clientId}/config/waterBills`
- Complete Firebase console step-by-step instructions for manual field addition

## Issues
None

## Important Findings
Discovered critical inconsistency in monetary field storage across the codebase:
- Primary waterbills config stores monetary values in centavos (e.g., ratePerM3: 2739 = $27.39)
- Projects structure stores in pesos (e.g., ratePerM3: 50 = $50.00)
- Bills service converts centavos to pesos (config.ratePerM3 / 100)
This inconsistency should be addressed to prevent calculation errors in future development.

## Next Steps
User can now implement the fields via Firebase console using the provided instructions. Fields are ready for integration into billing calculation logic.
