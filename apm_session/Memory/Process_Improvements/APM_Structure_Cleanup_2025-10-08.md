- **Archived 19 Implementation Agent Handover files** to proper archive location
- **Status:** No active handovers - all files archived

### 2. Task Assignment Organization
- **September 2025 Tasks:** Moved 20+ task assignments to `apm_session/Memory/Archive/Task_Assignments/September_2025/`
- **October 2025 Tasks:** Moved completed tasks to `apm_session/Memory/Archive/Task_Assignments/October_2025/`
- **Active Tasks:** Preserved in `apm_session/Memory/Task_Assignments/Active/`

### 3. Memory System Consolidation

- **Consolidated all Memory files** from root `Memory/` directory to `apm_session/Memory/`
- **Moved Task Completion Logs** to proper location
- **Organized Reviews** into archive structure

### 4. Root Directory Cleanup
- **Removed old Memory directory structure** after consolidation
- **Archived task assignments** from root directory
- **Moved handover prompts** from root to archive

  - ✅ Phase_XX_Name/ - Phase-based task logs
  - ✅ Task_Completion_Logs/ - Completed task records
  - ✅ Task_Assignments/Active/ - Current active tasks
  - ✅ Archive/ - Historical records organized by type and date
  - ✅ Handovers/ - Empty directories ready for future handovers

## Compliance with Guidelines

1. **Memory System Guide Compliance:**
   - All memory logs in `apm_session/Memory/` structure
   - Phase-based organization maintained
   - Memory_Root.md properly located

2. **Memory Log Guide Compliance:**
   - Task logs organized by phase
   - Completion logs in dedicated directory
   - Archive maintains historical context

3. **Handover Guide Compliance:**
   - Handover files properly archived when not active
   - Directory structure ready for future handovers
   - Implementation and Manager handovers separated

## Notes
- Removed duplicate Memory directory structure at root level
- Preserved all historical data in organized archive
- No data was deleted - only reorganized
- Structure now ready for continued APM operations

## Post-Cleanup Update
- **Additional cleanup performed:** Found and moved remaining Archive content from `/Memory/Archive/` to `apm_session/Memory/Archive/`
- **Removed root Memory directory entirely** - All 48 remaining files were archived content from September 2025
- **Final state:** No `/Memory` directory exists at root - all memory files properly consolidated in `apm_session/Memory/`
