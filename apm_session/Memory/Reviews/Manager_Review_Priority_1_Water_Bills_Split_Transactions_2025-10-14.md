# Manager Review: Priority 1 - Water Bills Split Transactions

## Review Summary

**Decision:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

Both Part A (Split Transactions) and Part B (Readings Auto-Advance) are complete, tested, and production-ready. The implementation provides the critical foundation for Statement of Account reporting (Priority 4) with excellent code quality and comprehensive documentation.

### Strengths

1. **Perfect Pattern Consistency**

   - Overpayment/credit usage: Correct handling

4. **Outstanding Problem-Solving**
   - Identified double currency conversion issue
   - Understood shared controller pattern
   - Fixed missing `currentCharge` property
   - Recovered from branch management error

5. **Exceptional Documentation**

## Important Findings Captured

### 1. System Currency Pattern (CRITICAL)
- Services provide dollars ‚Üí Controller converts to cents
- Never modify transactionsController for module issues
- Pattern shared across HOA Dues, Expenses, Water Bills

### 2. Split Transaction Pattern
- CategoryId: "-split-" (lowercase with hyphens)
- CategoryName: "-Split-" (title case)
- Established in UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx

### 3. Penalty Separation Requirement
- Statement of Account needs penalties separate
- Never combine base + penalty into single allocation
- Foundation for Priority 4 complete

### 4. Branch Management Lesson
- Always verify branch before starting work
- Check version.json for correct version
- Stash conflicts before switching
