## Task: Water Bills Browser Cache Issue

## Summary
Successfully resolved the Water Bills reading period display issue. The problem was not a browser cache issue as initially suspected, but a bug in the frontend code.

## Root Cause
The code was attempting to read `readingPeriod` from the current month's data (`monthData`), but for months without readings yet, this data doesn't exist. The `readingPeriod` actually comes from the prior month's data since it represents the timestamps when those readings were taken.

## Solution Implemented
Changed the code in `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/water/WaterReadingEntry.jsx`:

```javascript
// FROM:
if (monthData?.readingPeriod) {
  setReadingPeriod(monthData.readingPeriod);
}

// TO:
if (priorMonthData?.readingPeriod) {
  setReadingPeriod(priorMonthData.readingPeriod);
}
```

## Outcome
- Reading period now correctly displays as date range (e.g., "09/22/2025 - 09/23/2025")
- No browser cache clearing was needed
- All Water Bills tasks (2.1-2.5) are now fully functional

## Key Learning
When debugging display issues, always verify the data flow first. What appeared to be a caching issue was actually a logic error in reading from the wrong data source.
