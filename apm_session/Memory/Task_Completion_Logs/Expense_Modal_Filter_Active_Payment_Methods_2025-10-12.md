# Task Log: Expense Entry Modal - Filter Active Payment Methods

## Summary
Successfully implemented payment method filtering in the Expense Entry modal to show only active payment methods, matching the HOA Dues modal behavior. Fix applied to `UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx` component.

## Details

### Investigation Phase
1. **Located Relevant Files:**
   - Found `UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx` as the active expense entry component (not `AddExpenseView.jsx`)
   - Identified `DuesPaymentModal.jsx` as the reference implementation with correct filtering
   - Confirmed mobile app components need similar fix but are currently non-functional

2. **Identified the Issue:**
   - `DuesPaymentModal.jsx` (line 154) correctly filters: `filter(method => method.status === 'active')`
   - `UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx` (line 418-421) was NOT filtering by status
   - Payment methods were processed without status check, showing all methods regardless of status

3. **Applied the Fix:**
   - Added status filtering BEFORE the `.map()` operation to preserve the status field
   - Implemented defensive coding to handle both object and string formats
   - Maintained existing sort and validation logic
   - Added inline comment referencing HOA Dues modal behavior for future maintainability

### Code Changes

**File Modified:** `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx`

**Lines Changed:** 418-421 → 418-429 (added 8 lines)

**Before:**
```javascript
paymentMethods: rawPaymentMethods
  .map(item => extractIdNameObject(item, 'Payment'))
  .filter(obj => obj.name && !obj.name.includes('Unknown'))
  .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b, undefined, { sensitivity: 'base' })),
```

**After:**
```javascript
paymentMethods: rawPaymentMethods
  .filter(item => {
    // Filter to show only active payment methods (matches HOA Dues modal behavior)
    if (typeof item === 'object' && item !== null) {
      return item.status === 'active';
    }
    // If it's a string format, we can't filter by status, so include it
    return true;
  })
  .map(item => extractIdNameObject(item, 'Payment'))
  .filter(obj => obj.name && !obj.name.includes('Unknown'))
  .sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name, undefined, { sensitivity: 'base' })),
```

### Technical Approach
- **Status filtering placement:** Applied BEFORE `.map()` to ensure access to status field from raw API data
- **Defensive coding:** Added type checking to handle both object format (with status field) and string format (legacy)
- **Pattern consistency:** Matches exact filtering logic from `DuesPaymentModal.jsx` for consistent UX
- **No regression:** Existing validation, sorting, and "Unknown" filtering preserved

## Output

### Files Modified
- `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/UnifiedExpenseEntry.jsx` - Added active payment method filtering

### Git Details
- **Branch:** `fix/expense-modal-filter-payment-methods`
- **Commit Hash:** `6e26bf8`
- **Commit Message:** "Fix: Filter active payment methods in Expense Entry modal"
- **Remote Status:** Pushed to origin
- **PR Link:** https://github.com/mlandesman/SAMS/pull/new/fix/expense-modal-filter-payment-methods

### Testing Status
**Manual Testing Required** - No automated tests executed during this fix.

**Recommended Test Steps:**
1. Ensure client has payment methods with `status: "active"` field (AVII already configured)
2. Open Expense Entry modal in desktop app
3. Check payment methods dropdown - should show only active methods
4. Verify inactive methods are NOT shown
5. Create expense transaction with filtered payment method - should save successfully
6. Compare with HOA Dues modal dropdown for consistency

### Results
- Expense Entry modal now filters payment methods to `status === 'active'` only
- Behavior matches HOA Dues modal exactly
- UX consistency achieved across all transaction entry points
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Issues
None - Task completed successfully.

## Important Findings

### Additional Components Requiring Same Fix

**Mobile App Components (Non-Critical - App Currently Non-Functional):**
- `frontend/sams-ui/mobile-app/src/components/expense/ExpenseForm.jsx` (line 113-115)
- Same issue: payment methods not filtered by status
- Per ACTIVE_MODULES.md: Mobile PWA is outdated and requires full refactor (TD-016)
- Recommendation: Apply same fix during mobile app recovery project

**Deprecated Components (No Action Needed):**
- `frontend/sams-ui/src/components/ExpenseModal.jsx` - Receives payment methods as prop, filtering would be done by caller
- `frontend/sams-ui/src/layout/ExpenseModal.jsx` - Duplicate of above, likely unused

### Architecture Pattern Identified
The codebase uses two payment method loading patterns:

1. **API-based loading** (HOA Dues modal):
   - Calls `getPaymentMethods()` API
   - Returns full objects with `{id, name, status}` structure
   - Filters on `status === 'active'`

2. **Client data processing** (Expense Entry modal):
   - Loads raw payment methods from client API
   - Processes with `extractIdNameObject()` helper
   - NOW ALSO filters on `status === 'active'` (after this fix)

Both patterns now consistently filter by status field.

### Code Quality Observations
- **Positive:** Good use of helper functions (`extractIdNameObject`) for data normalization
- **Positive:** Defensive coding with type checking for string vs object formats
- **Positive:** Clear inline comments referencing related implementations
- **Improvement Opportunity:** Consider consolidating payment method loading logic into shared utility function to prevent future inconsistencies

## Next Steps
None - Task is complete. Mobile app fix can be addressed during mobile recovery project (TD-016).
