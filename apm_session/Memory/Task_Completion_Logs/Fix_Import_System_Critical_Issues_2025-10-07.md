# Task Log: Fix Import System Critical Issues

## Summary
Successfully fixed three critical issues in the Import/Purge System blocking client onboarding: (1) missing getNow import causing ReferenceError, (2) silent 5-10 minute import process with no progress feedback, and (3) missing file validation allowing partial imports. Additionally discovered and fixed 4 additional date-related violations in the same file.

## Details

### Step 1: Fix Missing getNow Import and Date Violations

**Primary Issue:** `importService.js` was using `getNow()` throughout but missing the import statement, causing `ReferenceError: getNow is not defined`.

**Additional Issues Found:** During verification, discovered 4 additional date-related violations of CRITICAL CODING GUIDELINES:
- Line 1108: `new Date(tx.date)` - parsing transaction dates
- Line 1128: `new Date('2025-01-01')` - hardcoded calendar year start
- Line 1209: `Date.now()` - in ID generator
- Line 1054: `new Date(dateStr)` - parsing dates from notes
- Line 1428: `new Date(\`${fiscalYear}-12-31\`)` - hardcoded year-end date

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Added Required Imports** (Lines 9-11):
   - Added `DateTime` from luxon
   - Added `getNow` to DateService import
   - Added `getFiscalYear`, `getFiscalYearBounds`, `validateFiscalYearConfig` from fiscalYearUtils

2. **Implemented Client Config Caching** (Lines 48, 55-76, 260-270):
   - Added `clientConfigCache` instance variable to avoid repeated DB calls
   - Created `getClientConfig()` helper method with cache and DB fallback
   - Modified `importConfig()` to cache client document after import
   - Ensures fiscal year config is available for all subsequent imports

3. **Fixed All Date Violations:**
   - **Line 1148**: Parse transaction dates with `DateTime.fromISO(tx.date, { zone: 'America/Cancun' })`
   - **Lines 1169-1177**: Replace hardcoded `'2025-01-01'` with dynamic fiscal year start:
     ```javascript
     const clientConfig = await this.getClientConfig();
     const fiscalYearStartMonth = validateFiscalYearConfig(clientConfig);
     const { startDate } = getFiscalYearBounds(year, fiscalYearStartMonth);
     timestamp: startDate // Start of fiscal year (e.g., July 1, 2024 for AVII FY 2025)
     ```
   - **Line 1258**: Replace `Date.now()` with `getNow().getTime()`
   - **Lines 1053-1065**: Parse notes dates using `DateTime.fromRFC2822()` and `DateTime.fromHTTP()`
   - **Lines 1437-1440**: Replace hardcoded year-end with `DateTime.fromObject({ year, month: 12, day: 31 }, { zone: 'America/Cancun' })`

**Key Improvement:** Starting balance timestamps now respect client's fiscal year configuration instead of hardcoded calendar year. For AVII (July-June fiscal year), starting balance is dated July 1, 2024 for FY 2025, not January 1, 2025.

### Step 2: Add Progress Tracking to Onboarding Flow

**Problem:** When onboarding new client via client selector, system navigates to Data Management tab and silently starts 5-10 minute import with NO progress bars, spinners, or status updates.

**Root Cause:** `ClientSwitchModal.jsx` calls import endpoint and navigates immediately, but `ImportManagement.jsx` doesn't start polling for onboarding imports.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Modified ClientSwitchModal.jsx** (Line 168):
   - Added `startProgressPolling: true` flag to localStorage onboarding data
   - Signals ImportManagement to begin polling immediately

2. **Modified ImportManagement.jsx** (Lines 54-62):
   - Detects `startProgressPolling` flag in onboarding data
   - Initializes progress state: `{ status: 'starting', sequence: [], components: {} }`
   - Calls `pollProgress()` immediately to start 1-second interval polling
   - User sees real-time progress for all import components

**User Experience Improvement:**
- **Before:** Silent 5-10 minute import, users confused
- **After:** Immediate progress bars showing component-by-component status with real-time updates

### Step 3: Add Pre-Import File Validation

**Problem:** Import process starts even if required files are missing, causing partial imports that leave database in inconsistent state requiring full purge before retry.

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created Validation Function in ImportFileUploader.jsx** (Lines 34-55, 236-257):
   - Added `validateRequiredFiles()` internal function
   - Exported `validateRequiredImportFiles()` for use in other components
   - Validates 9 required files:
     - Client.json
     - config.json
     - Categories.json
     - Vendors.json
     - Units.json
     - Transactions.json
     - HOADues.json
     - paymentMethods.json
     - yearEndBalances.json

2. **Added Frontend Validation in ClientSwitchModal.jsx** (Lines 12, 139-146):
   - Imported `validateRequiredImportFiles`
   - Added validation check in `handleOnboardClient()` before upload
   - Shows clear error message listing missing files
   - Prevents upload and import if validation fails

3. **Added Backend Validation in importService.js** (Lines 1570-1602, 1610-1616):
   - Created `validateRequiredFiles()` method
   - Attempts to load each required file
   - Collects list of missing files
   - Throws error with complete list if any files missing
   - Called at start of `executeImport()` before any database writes

**Defense in Depth:** Validation at both frontend (before upload) and backend (before import) ensures no partial imports regardless of entry point.

## Output

### Modified Files:

**Backend:**
- `/backend/services/importService.js`
  - Lines 9-11: Added imports (DateTime, getNow, fiscal year utils)
  - Line 48: Added clientConfigCache instance variable
  - Lines 55-76: Added getClientConfig() helper method
  - Lines 260-270: Cache client config after importing config collection
  - Line 1148: Fixed transaction date parsing with DateTime
  - Lines 1169-1177: Fixed starting balance timestamp with fiscal year start

  - Lines 1437-1440: Fixed year-end date creation with DateTime
  - Lines 1570-1602: Added validateRequiredFiles() method
  - Lines 1610-1616: Call validation before executeImport()

**Frontend:**
- `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/ImportFileUploader.jsx`
  - Lines 34-55: Added internal validateRequiredFiles() function
  - Lines 236-257: Exported validateRequiredImportFiles() for external use

- `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/ClientSwitchModal.jsx`
  - Line 12: Imported validateRequiredImportFiles
  - Lines 139-146: Added validation check in handleOnboardClient()
  - Line 168: Added startProgressPolling flag to localStorage

- `/frontend/sams-ui/src/components/Settings/ImportManagement.jsx`
  - Lines 54-62: Detect startProgressPolling flag and start polling immediately

### Testing Results:

**Manual Testing Required:** All three fixes require manual testing with actual client onboarding:

1. **getNow Import Fix:**
   - Navigate to Data Management
   - Click "Import All Data"
   - Verify no ReferenceError in console
   - Verify import progress starts normally

2. **Onboarding Progress Tracking:**
   - Click client selector
   - Choose "-New Client-"
   - Upload complete file set
   - Click "Preview Client" then "Onboard Client"
   - **VERIFY:** Immediate navigation to Data Management
   - **VERIFY:** Progress bars appear immediately (not silent)
   - **VERIFY:** Real-time updates for each component
   - **VERIFY:** Completion status displays correctly

3. **File Validation:**
   - Attempt onboarding with missing `Categories.json`
   - **VERIFY:** Error message: "Missing required files: Categories.json"
   - **VERIFY:** Import does NOT start
   - **VERIFY:** No database writes occur
   - Add missing file and retry
   - **VERIFY:** Import proceeds normally

4. **Fiscal Year Start Date:**
   - After successful import, check credit balance history in Firestore
   - For AVII (July-June fiscal year), verify starting_balance entry timestamp is July 1, 2024 (not January 1, 2025)
   - For calendar year clients, verify starting_balance entry timestamp is January 1 of fiscal year

## Issues
None

## Important Findings

### Date Violations Were Widespread
Found 5 date-related violations beyond the original getNow import issue. This suggests a need for:
- Automated linting rules to catch `new Date()` and `Date.now()` usage
- Code review checklist for date handling
- Developer training on DateService usage

### Fiscal Year Configuration Critical for Imports
The hardcoded `'2025-01-01'` starting balance date would have caused incorrect historical data for all fiscal year clients. The fix ensures:
- Starting balances are dated at fiscal year start, not calendar year
- Works correctly for both calendar year (January start) and fiscal year (any month start) clients
- Respects client configuration loaded during import process

### Import Timing and Config Availability
Confirmed that client document and config collection are imported BEFORE HOA dues and other components that need fiscal year info. The caching strategy ensures:
- Config loaded once during importConfig() step
- Cached config available for all subsequent import steps
- Fallback to DB query for standalone component imports
- No timing issues with Firestore writes

### Progress Polling Pattern
The existing `pollProgress()` function in ImportManagement was well-designed and only needed a trigger. The flag-based approach:
- Minimal code changes required
- Clean separation of concerns
- Works for both onboarding and regular imports
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-up Tasks:

1. **Add Automated Tests:**
   - Unit tests for validateRequiredFiles() (frontend and backend)
   - Integration test for onboarding flow with progress tracking
   - Test fiscal year start date calculation for various configurations

2. **Add Linting Rules:**
   - ESLint rule to flag `new Date()` usage
   - ESLint rule to flag `Date.now()` usage
   - Suggest `getNow()` from DateService as replacement

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update import documentation to list required files
   - Document fiscal year handling in import process
   - Add troubleshooting guide for import validation errors

4. **Optional Files Handling:**
   - Consider adding warning (not error) for optional files:
     - Users.json
     - AutoCategorize.json
     - UnitSizes.json
     - WaterBills.json
     - WaterBillsReadings.json
   - Show which optional files are present/missing in preview

5. **Progress Tracking Enhancement:**
   - Consider adding estimated time remaining
   - Add component-level progress percentages
   - Show file sizes being processed
