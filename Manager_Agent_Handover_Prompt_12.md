# APM Manager Agent Handover - Manager Agent 13
You are taking over as Manager Agent 13 for ongoing project management from Manager Agent 12.

## Context Integration Protocol
1. **Read Memory Log Guide** (`apm/prompts/guides/Memory_Log_Guide.md`) to understand Memory Log structure and Manager Agent logging responsibilities
2. **Read outgoing agent's Memory Logs** (chronological order) (`apm_session/Memory/Archive/Phase_01_ClientSwitchModal_Fix/`) to understand task execution history, outcomes, and blockers
3. **State your understanding of your logging responsibilities** based on the guide and **await User confirmation** to proceed to the next step
4. **Read Handover File** (`apm_session/Memory/Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handovers/Manager_Agent_Handover_File_12.md`) for active memory context of the outgoing agent not captured in Memory Logs

## Cross-Reference Validation
Compare Handover File active memory against your Memory Logs for task execution outcomes and working environment context. Note contradictions for User clarification.

## Current Task Context
- **Last Completed Task:** MTC PaymentMethods Import Fix and AVII Client.json Recovery
- **Working Environment:** Backend running on port 5001, frontend on 5174, Firebase dev environment, MTC data successfully imported, AVII client.json corrected and ready
- **User Preferences:** Prefers elegant solutions that work with existing system architecture, values clear problem identification, appreciates straightforward approaches, prefers manual data transformation when automated solutions are unreliable

## User Verification Protocol
After context synthesis: ask 1-2 assurance questions about task execution history accuracy, if contradictions found ask specific clarification questions, await explicit User confirmation before proceeding.

**Immediate Next Action:** Continue with current implementation plan priorities, focusing on AVII client data recovery and import once water bill payments data extraction is resolved

## Current Implementation Plan Status

### **Priority 1: Credit Balance Fixes** │ Agent_Credit_Balance
- **Status:** Critical foundation issue affecting payment processing
- **Effort:** 2-3 Implementation Agent sessions
- **Next:** Ready for Implementation Agent assignment

### **Priority 1.5: Water Bills Data Import/Export System** │ Agent_Water_Import  
- **Status:** AVII client.json recovered and ready, water bill payments extraction in progress
- **User Note:** Water bill payments proving challenging to extract in proper JSON format, may require manual processing
- **Effort:** 5-6 Implementation Agent sessions (pending data extraction completion)

### **Priority 2: Water Bills Fixes** │ Agent_Water_Bills
- **Status:** Five specific issues affecting Water Bills functionality
- **Effort:** 1-2 Implementation Agent sessions
- **Next:** Ready for Implementation Agent assignment

### **Priority 3: HOA Dues Quarterly Collection Support** │ Agent_HOA_Quarterly
- **Status:** Data-driven architecture change for client flexibility  
- **Effort:** 4-5 Implementation Agent sessions
- **Next:** Ready for Implementation Agent assignment

## Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ **MTC PaymentMethods Import Fix**: Fixed collection name mismatch (paymentTypes → paymentMethods)
- ✅ **AVII Client.json Recovery**: Corrected corrupted file with proper AVII data structure
- ✅ **Documentation Updates**: Updated implementation plan and todos
- ✅ **Archive Management**: Properly archived completed work
- ✅ **Git Operations**: All changes committed, merged, and pushed

## Working Environment Status
- **MTC Client**: Fully imported and operational
- **AVII Client**: client.json corrected and ready for import (pending water bill payments data)
- **Import System**: Production-ready and fully functional
- **Git Repository**: Clean and up-to-date

Acknowledge receipt and begin context integration protocol immediately.
