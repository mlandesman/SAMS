## 🎯 Where Does This Go?

| Situation | Action | Command/Location |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| 🚨 Production broken | GitHub Issue + `critical` label | `gh issue create --label critical,bug` |
| 🔥 Work on this week | GitHub Issue + priority label | `gh issue create --label bug,high-priority` |
| 💡 Good idea for later | Add to master tracker backlog | Edit `PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md` |
| 🧩 Messy code found | Add to technical debt | Edit `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` |
| ⚡ Quick fix (< 15 min) | Just fix it | `git commit -m "Quick fix: ..."` |

- ✅ Always check `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` before starting work
- ✅ Weekly sync ritual prevents lost issues
- ✅ Reference issues in commits for traceability

## 🆘 Emergency Troubleshooting

**Cursor doesn't see my issues?**
→ Check `.cursorrules` is up-to-date
→ Explicitly mention file: "Check PROJECT_TRACKING_MASTER.md"

**Can't find an issue?**
→ Run: `./scripts/sync-issues.sh` → option 4

**Too many issues?**
→ Archive old ones, keep GitHub under 20 active

**GitHub CLI not working?**
→ `gh auth status` and `gh auth login` if needed
