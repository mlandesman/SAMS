## User Story

We have a ton of fields in the /clients/:clientId/config collection that are unique to each client.  Each document has many fields that are used throughout the code.  We should ccreate a generalized view and edit function inside of Settings that just lists all collections then all documents then all fields recursively.  We will never know what config data each client has but we need to allow an Admin to edit them for data-driven functions.

## Description



## Business Value

Maintenance of Clients requires this.
