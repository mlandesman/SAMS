## User Story

We need a system to maintaince repeatable and/or schedulable tasks.  Examples are "Log Water Meter Readings on the last work day of each month" and "Change the cistern water filter every 6 months".  Another, different example would be connected to HOA Dues and Special Assessments.  "Sent email follow p to all units who have not paid their monthly dues 1on the 10th day of the new month and add x% penalty".  "Contact Special Assessment #30 Contractor for project status 30 days after project start".  The TMS should be able to be "attached" to different documents in our DB (HOA Dues Payment, SProjects, etc).  The TMS should provide basic ToDo list functionality on its own when not connected to another module.  "Change water filter" task is an example of a disconnected task.
