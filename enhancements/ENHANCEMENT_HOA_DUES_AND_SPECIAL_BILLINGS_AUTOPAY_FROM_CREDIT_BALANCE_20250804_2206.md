## User Story

Upon loading or as a nightly scheduled task, any unit that is past due in their HOA and/or Special Billings (for example, water consumption bill) that has sufficient credit balance to cover a full payment should have that payment made and  credit balance reduced accordingly.  This will require comprehenisive notes within the transaction, an automated Digital Receipt send to the owner and property manager and some form of notification to the administrators and superAdmins for verification and confirmation after the fact.
