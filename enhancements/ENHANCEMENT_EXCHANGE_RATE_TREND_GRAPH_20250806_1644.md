## User Story

Using our historical exchangeRates create a trend graph for the trailing 6 months showing USD vs MXP.  The first phase can use just 6 months and just USD hardcoded.  A future phase could add user-selected periods and currencies.  The graph will be used on both desktop UI and mobile app when the Exchange Rates dashboard card is clicked or tapped.  On the mobile-app that tap currently brings up the calculator so we will have to detail with the UI/UX for that.
