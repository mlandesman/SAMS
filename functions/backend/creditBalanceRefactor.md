# Credit Balance Data Architecture - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## Problem Solved
Previously stored credit balance data in two places:
1. Transaction documents (creditBalanceAdded, creditUsed, newCreditBalance) ❌ REMOVED
2. HOA Dues documents (creditBalanceHistory array) ✅ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

This created synchronization risks and data consistency issues - NOW RESOLVED.

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION: Single Source of Truth ✅

### Current Architecture: HOA Dues Document as Master ✅

**ALL credit balance data is stored ONLY in the HOA dues document:**

```javascript
// clients/{clientId}/units/{unitId}/dues/{year}
{
  creditBalance: 286,
  creditBalanceHistory: [
    {
      id: "uuid",
      timestamp: "2025-06-22T15:29:57.000Z",
      transactionId: "vYfSe3V9wTK9VQ1rYUGv", // Reference to transaction
      type: "credit_used",
      amount: 900,
      description: "from bank_transfer",
      balanceBefore: 1186,
      balanceAfter: 286,
      notes: "HOA Dues payment for Unit 1B - Jun 2025"
    }
  ],
  payments: [...],
  scheduledAmount: 4400
}
```

**Transaction documents NO LONGER contain credit fields:**
- ❌ REMOVED: creditBalanceAdded, creditUsed, newCreditBalance
- ✅ KEEP: metadata.type = "hoa_dues" for identification only

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Architecture Chosen: HOA Dues as Master
- **Rationale**: 
  - Credit balances are unit-specific data
  - Easier to query unit credit status
  - Cleaner separation of concerns
  - No synchronization issues

### ✅ Migration Completed
1. ✅ Removed credit fields from all transaction documents
2. ✅ All credit balance history stored in dues documents
3. ✅ Code updated to prevent future duplication

### ✅ Code Updated
1. ✅ Removed credit balance fields from transaction creation
2. ✅ Updated deletion logic to analyze dues documents only
3. ✅ Added referential integrity via credit history analysis

## Benefits
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ No synchronization issues
- ✅ Simpler transaction operations
- ✅ Cleaner data model
- ✅ Easier debugging and maintenance

## Migration Considerations
- Need to update all existing transaction documents
- Frontend code needs to be updated to not expect credit fields in transactions
- API responses need to be adjusted
