# Water Bills Import Implementation Summary

**Branch:** `feature/water-bills-import`  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Agent:** Agent_Water_Bills_CrossRef  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete Water Bills import system that follows the chronological workflow of the actual water bills management system. The import simulates month-by-month data entry: readings → bills → payments, ensuring proper carryover of unpaid balances and penalties.

---

## Implementation Details

### **1. Water Bills Transaction CrossRef Generation**

**File:** `backend/services/importService.js` (lines 637-642, 788-815, 853-871)

**What it does:**
- Scans transactions during import for `Category === "Water Consumption"`
- Extracts `PAY-*` sequence from unnamed field (`transaction[""]`)
- Builds CrossRef mapping `PAY-*` → Firebase transaction ID
- Saves to `Water_Bills_Transaction_CrossRef.json`

**Structure:**
```javascript
{
  generated: "2025-10-08T...",
  totalRecords: 15,
  byPaymentSeq: {
    "PAY-101 (Zerbarini)-20250717-25": {
      transactionId: "firebase-generated-id",
      unitId: "101",
      amount: 1139.73,
      date: "2025-07-17T...",
      notes: "June Water Bill (BBVA)"
    }
  },
  byUnit: {
    "101": [
      { paymentSeq: "PAY-101...", transactionId: "...", amount: 1139.73, date: "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **2. Chronological Water Bills Import**

**File:** `backend/services/importService.js` (lines 1534-1879)

**Main Method:** `importWaterBills(user)`

**What it does:**
1. Checks if water bills files exist (`waterMeterReadings.json`, `waterCrossRef.json`)
2. Loads all required data files
3. Builds chronological processing order
4. Processes each month cycle: readings → bills → payments
5. Returns summary of import results

**Processing Flow:**
```
May 2025 readings → June 2025 billing (FY2025-11) → (no payments)
June 2025 readings → July 2025 billing (FY2026-00) → 9 payments applied
July 2025 readings → August 2025 billing (FY2026-01) → 2 payments applied
August 2025 readings → September 2025 billing (FY2026-02) → 2 payments applied
September 2025 readings → October 2025 billing (FY2026-03) → 1 payment applied
```

---

### **3. Helper Methods**

#### **buildWaterBillsChronology(readingsData, waterCrossRef, txnCrossRef)**
- Parses `waterMeterReadings.json` into monthly structure
- Groups payments by billing month
- Calculates fiscal year/month for each cycle
- Returns ordered array of cycles

#### **importMonthReadings(cycle)**
- Separates regular units from special meters (Building, Common)
- Calls `waterReadingsService.saveReadings()` with proper fiscal year/month
- Saves to `/clients/{clientId}/projects/waterBills/readings/{year-month}`

#### **generateMonthBills(cycle)**
- Calls existing `waterBillsService.generateBills()`
- Generates bills from readings with consumption calculations
- Applies penalties to unpaid prior bills
- Saves to `/clients/{clientId}/projects/waterBills/bills/{year-month}`

#### **processMonthPayments(cycle)**
- Groups charges by payment sequence
- Calculates totals for base charges and penalties
- Finds which bills each payment applies to
- Updates bill documents with payment info

#### **findBillsForCharges(charges)**
- Maps `ChargeDate` to fiscal year/month
- Groups charges by bill document
- Separates base charges (WC) from penalties (WCP)
- Returns array of bill updates

#### **applyPaymentToBill(billUpdate)**
- Updates bill document in Firestore
- Increments `paidAmount`, `basePaid`, `penaltyPaid`
- Updates bill status (unpaid → partial → paid)
- Uses Firestore field path updates for nested objects

### **4. Integration into Import Flow**

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/services/importService.js` - Added to import order
- `backend/controllers/importController.js` - Added to import sequence

**Import Sequence:**
```
1. Client Document
2. Config Collection
3. Payment Methods
4. Categories
5. Vendors
6. Units
7. Year End Balances
8. Transactions (generates Water Bills CrossRef)
9. HOA Dues
10. Water Bills ← NEW (optional, requires CrossRef)
```

**Optional Component Handling:**
- Marked as `optional: true` in import sequence
- Skips gracefully if files not found
- Doesn't stop import if it fails
- Logs skip reason for transparency

---

## Data Structure Mapping

### **Input Files:**

1. **waterMeterReadings.json** (from Google Sheets export)
```javascript
[
  {
    Unit: "101",
    "Thu May 01 2025 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)": 1749,
    "Sun Jun 01 2025 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)": 1767,
    // ... more months
  }
]
```

2. **waterCrossRef.json** (from Google Sheets export)
```javascript
[
  {
    PaymentSeq: "PAY-101 (Zerbarini)-20250717-25",
    PaymentDate: "2025-07-17T14:43:24.359Z",
    Unit: 101,
    ChargeSeq: "CHG-101 (Zerbarini)-20250701-WC-8",
    ChargeDate: "2025-07-01T05:00:00.000Z",
    Category: "WC",  // or "WCP" for penalties
    AmountApplied: 900
  }
]
```

3. **Transactions.json** (existing)
```javascript
{
  "": "PAY-201 (Ische)-20251002-96",  // Payment sequence
  Date: "2025-10-02T22:22:32.612Z",
  Vendor: "Deposit",
  Category: "Water Consumption",  // Identifies water bill payments
  Unit: "201 (Ische)",
  Amount: 50,
  Account: "Scotiabank",
  Notes: "Verbeck (Sep 2025)"
}
```

### **Output Structure:**

1. **Readings:** `/clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/readings/2026-00`
```javascript
{
  year: 2026,
  month: 0,
  readings: {
    "101": 1767,
    "102": 26,
    // ...
  },
  buildingMeter: 18313,
  commonArea: 1700,
  timestamp: Timestamp
}
```

2. **Bills:** `/clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/2026-00`
```javascript
{
  billDate: "2025-07-01T...",
  dueDate: "2025-07-11T...",
  fiscalYear: 2026,
  fiscalMonth: 0,
  bills: {
    units: {
      "101": {
        currentCharge: 90.00,
        penaltyAmount: 0,
        totalAmount: 90.00,
        paidAmount: 900.00,  // Updated by payment
        basePaid: 900.00,    // Updated by payment
        penaltyPaid: 0,      // Updated by payment
        status: "paid",      // Updated by payment
        // ... other fields
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Fiscal Year Conversion

**AVII Fiscal Year:** July start (month 7)

**Conversion Table:**
| Calendar Month | Fiscal Year | Fiscal Month |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| May 2025       | FY2025      | 10           |
| June 2025      | FY2025      | 11 (last)    |
| July 2025      | FY2026      | 0 (first)    |
| August 2025    | FY2026      | 1            |
| September 2025 | FY2026      | 2            |
| October 2025   | FY2026      | 3            |

**Utilities Used:**
- `getFiscalYear(date, fiscalYearStartMonth)` from `utils/fiscalYearUtils.js`
- Fiscal month calculated as: `calendarMonth - fiscalYearStartMonth` (with wrap-around)

## Testing Results

### **Test 1: CrossRef Mapping** ✅
- **File:** `testWaterBillsCrossRefStandalone.js`
- **Result:** 100% linkage rate (14/14 payments linked)
- **Validation:** All `PAY-*` sequences found in transactions

### **Test 2: Data Validation** ✅
- **File:** `testWaterBillsDataValidation.js`
- **Result:** All data files accessible, fiscal year conversion correct
- **Validation:** 15 water transactions, 5 months of readings, 46 charges

### **Test 3: Chronology Building** ✅
- **File:** `testWaterBillsCompleteImport.js`
- **Result:** 5 month cycles correctly ordered
- **Validation:** Proper fiscal year transitions, payment grouping correct

---

## Key Design Decisions

### **1. Chronological Processing (Critical)**
**Why:** Bills depend on prior payments. Must process in order: readings → bills → payments for each month.

**Example:** 
- July bill generation sees June bill is paid → no carryover
- August bill generation sees July bill is partial → carries forward balance + penalties

### **2. Use Existing Services**
**Why:** Ensures consistency with UI data entry workflow.

**Services Used:**
- `waterReadingsService.saveReadings()` - Same as UI reading entry
- `waterBillsService.generateBills()` - Same as UI bill generation
- Direct Firestore updates for payments - Matches payment recording pattern

### **3. Optional Component**
**Why:** Not all clients have water bills (only AVII currently).

**Implementation:**
- Checks for file existence before processing
- Returns `{ skipped: true }` if files not found
- Doesn't fail entire import if water bills fail

### **4. Multi-Charge Payment Handling**
**Why:** Single payment can apply to multiple bills (different months).

**Implementation:**
- Groups charges by `PaymentSeq`
- Maps each charge to its fiscal year/month bill
- Updates multiple bill documents per payment

---

## Files Modified

### **Backend:**
1. `backend/services/importService.js`
   - Added Water Bills CrossRef generation (lines 637-642, 788-815, 853-871)

   - Added helper methods (lines 1617-1879)

2. `backend/controllers/importController.js`
   - Added waterbills to import sequence (line 1087)
   - Added waterbills case to switch statement (lines 1189-1191)
   - Added optional component handling (lines 1197-1241)

### **Tests Created:**
1. `backend/testing/testWaterBillsCrossRefStandalone.js` - CrossRef mapping validation
2. `backend/testing/testWaterBillsDataValidation.js` - Data structure validation
3. `backend/testing/testWaterBillsCrossRefGeneration.js` - CrossRef generation test

## Next Steps for Live Testing

### **Prerequisites:**
1. ✅ Code implemented and committed to `feature/water-bills-import` branch
2. ✅ All simulation tests passing
3. ⏳ Need to run full import with AVII data

### **Test Procedure:**
1. **Upload AVII data** to Firebase Storage (if not already there)
2. **Run full import** through UI or API
3. **Verify:**
   - Water Bills CrossRef generated
   - Readings imported (5 months)
   - Bills generated (5 months)
   - Payments applied correctly
   - Bill statuses updated (paid/partial/unpaid)

### **Validation Queries:**
```javascript
// Check readings
GET /clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/readings/2026-00

// Check bills
GET /clients/AVII/projects/waterBills/bills/2026-00

// Check bill payment status for Unit 101
// Should show: paidAmount: 900, status: "paid" for July bill
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Fiscal Year Hardcoded:** Currently uses `FISCAL_YEAR_START_MONTH = 7` for AVII
   - **Future:** Load from client config dynamically

2. **No Transaction Allocations:** Unlike HOA Dues, we don't add allocations to transactions
   - **Reason:** Water bills already have detailed payment tracking in bill documents
   - **Future:** Could add if needed for transaction detail view

3. **No Progress Tracking:** Water bills import doesn't emit progress events yet
   - **Future:** Add progress events for readings, bills, payments

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **All Completed:**
- [x] Water Bills CrossRef generated during transaction import
- [x] Readings imported chronologically with proper fiscal year mapping

- [x] All simulation tests passing
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Code committed to feature branch

⏳ **Pending Live Test:**
- [ ] Full import with AVII data
- [ ] Verify data in Firestore
- [ ] Verify UI displays correctly

## Ready for Michael's Review

The implementation is complete and all simulation tests pass. The system is ready for a live import test with AVII data to verify:
1. Readings are saved correctly
2. Bills are generated with proper consumption calculations
3. Payments update bill statuses correctly
4. Fiscal year transitions work properly
5. Special meters (Building, Common) are handled correctly

**Recommendation:** Run a full import on the `feature/water-bills-import` branch and verify the data in Firestore before merging to main.
