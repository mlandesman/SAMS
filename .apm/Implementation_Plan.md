### v1.2.0 - Year-End Processing Features (December 21-31, 2025)
**STATUS:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Deadline Dec 31, 2025

#### Design Decisions (Confirmed by Michael - Dec 21, 2025)

| Decision | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Scripts vs Features | **Permanent Settings activity** |
| Credit Balance Model | **Hybrid:** Credits stay as credits; nightly job auto-pays before penalty |
| Bill Selection | **Admin chooses:** UPS modal with checkboxes to include/exclude bills |
| Auto-Pay Timing | `billDueDate + gracePeriod - 1 day` (pay before penalty starts) |
| Accounting Method | **Accrual basis** - HOA Dues = applied to months; Account Credit = deferred |
| Budget Split Income | HOA Dues (applied) separate from Account Credit (prepayments) |

#### GitHub Issues Created (December 22, 2025)

- **#89** - [CRITICAL] UPS Bill Selection Checkboxes (4-5 hrs)
- **#90** - [CRITICAL] Nightly Credit Auto-Pay Scheduled Job (4-5 hrs)
- **#91** - [HIGH] Settings: Account Reconciliation Module (4-6 hrs)

## 🚨 URGENT: CRITICAL BUGS (IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED)

**Status:** 🔴 BLOCKING PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Critical Priority Issues

| Issue | Title | Priority | Impact | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| **#95** | Transaction Edit Modal does not read data properly | 🔥 CRITICAL | Core functionality broken - cannot edit transactions | 🔴 OPEN |
| **#59** | UPS payment doesn't recalculate Account Balances | 🟡 HIGH | Dashboard shows stale data after payments | 🔴 OPEN |

**Action Required:**
- **#95** - Transaction editing is broken. Fields are empty when opening edit modal. **BLOCKS** transaction corrections.
- **#59** - Account balances don't auto-update after UPS payments. Manual recalculation required. **IMPACTS** user trust in dashboard.

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours each (4-8 hours total)

---

## 🚨 URGENT: YEAR-END 2025 PROCESSING (MTC)

**Timeline:** Must be complete by December 31, 2025 (8 days remaining)
**Status:** 🔄 IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS

### Pre-Year-End Blockers ✅ RESOLVED (December 21, 2025)

All report blockers fixed:
- ✅ **#81** - Budget vs Actual Report layout - FIXED
- ✅ **#80** - Statement of Account project payments - FIXED
- ✅ **#82** - Budget Report notes - CLOSED (data issue)
- ✅ **#83** - Budget category filtering - ENHANCED

### Year-End Feature Development (v1.2.0)

| Issue | Feature | Priority | Status |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| #89 | UPS Bill Selection Checkboxes | 🔥 CRITICAL | ✅ COMPLETE Dec 22 |
| #91 | Account Reconciliation Module | 🟡 HIGH | ✅ COMPLETE Dec 22 |
| #88 | Budget vs Actual Accrual Basis | 🟢 MEDIUM | ✅ COMPLETE Dec 23 |
| #93 | Budget Split Income (HOA vs Credit) | 🟢 MEDIUM | ✅ COMPLETE Dec 23 (merged with #88) |
| #87 | Year-End Processing UI | 🟡 HIGH | Dec 24 |
| #90 | Nightly Credit Auto-Pay Job | 🔥 CRITICAL | DEFERRED - no pending payments |

### Key Design Decisions (Confirmed Dec 21, 2025)

1. **Hybrid credit balance model** - Credits stay as credits; nightly job auto-pays before penalties
2. **Bill selection in UPS** - Admin checkboxes to include/exclude bills from payment
3. **Auto-pay timing** - `dueDate + gracePeriod - 1 day` prevents penalties
4. **Split income tracking** - HOA Dues (applied) separate from Account Credit (prepayments)
5. **Build permanent Settings features** - not one-off scripts
6. **Accrual accounting** - use application date, not activity date

### Test Case: PH4D Prepayment (Hybrid Model)

```
Credit Balance: $14,400 MXN
Monthly HOA: $5,800 MXN

Behavior:
- Credit stays as $14,400 in credit balance
- When Jan bill approaches penalty date (dueDate + gracePeriod - 1):
  - Nightly job auto-pays $5,800 from credit
  - Notification sent to owner
- Same for Feb bill when it approaches penalty
- Credit reduced over time as bills come due
```

### Timeline

- **Dec 22:** ✅ #89 UPS Bill Selection Enhancement - COMPLETE
- **Dec 23:** #90 Nightly Credit Auto-Pay Job
- **Dec 24-25:** #91 Account Reconciliation Module
- **Dec 26-27:** #92 Year-End Processing UI
- **Dec 28-29:** Integration testing
- **Dec 30:** Production deployment

- Client logo and full name display

**Data Structure:**
```
/clients/{clientId}/categories/{categoryId}/budget/{year}
  - amount: number (centavos)
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
```

**Implementation Steps:**

**Step 1: Budget Entry UI (Dec 3-4)**
- Wire existing Budget activity placeholder in sidebar
- Call categories endpoint (already exists for modal pulldowns)
- Display table: Category | 2025 Budget | 2026 Budget (editable)
- Save to Firestore: `/clients/{clientId}/categories/{categoryId}/budget/{year}`

- YTD Budget = Annual Budget × (% of fiscal year elapsed)
- YTD Actual = Sum of transactions by category (existing filter code)
- Uses existing fiscal year logic (MTC: Jan-Dec, AVII: Jul-Jun)

**Resources Available:**
- ✅ Sidebar placeholder for Budget activity
- ✅ Categories endpoint (used in modal pulldowns)
- ✅ Transaction filter by category
- ✅ 2025 budget exists as JSON file

### Single Unit Client Implementation │ GitHub #54
**Status:** 📋 BACKLOG (Strategic Enhancement)  
**Estimated Effort:** 10-15 sessions (leverages existing code)  
**Target:** 2026 - After Tasks/Calendar, Projects expansion, and Additional Reports  
**Can Run In Parallel:** Yes - same underlying code, different filters/presentation

### Client-Specific Statement Footers │ GitHub #77
**Status:** 📋 BACKLOG (Medium Priority)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Scope:** Add `statementFooter` field (EN/ES) to client config, update statement template  
**Business Value:** Each client can have unique payment instructions and terms

**Executive Summary:**
Extend SAMS to support individual homes/condos managed by Sandyland Properties (SLP). Currently 10+ properties with 4 owners. Leverages existing modules with minimal modification.

**Architecture Principle: Square = Special Rectangle**
Single unit clients are modeled as a special case of Associations, not a separate system:
- Same underlying code and data structures
- Different filters and limited function visibility within common modules
- One "owner" to report to (vs. multiple unit owners in HOA)
- Presentation differences only - nothing structural changes

**Business Value:**
- Single point of entry for all SLP business activities
- Common interface accessible from anywhere
- Proper logging and backup
- Foundation for Tasks/Calendar features across all clients
- Shared vendor database with notes and skill sets

**Client Type: Single Unit**
- No HOA Dues concept (vs. Association fixed schedule)
- Owner sends funds on-demand to cover scheduled bills ("burn down" model)
- Client can switch between units (like Admin switches between Associations)
- Enables rollup and individual reporting

**Modules Reusable (Identical/Near-Identical):**
- ✅ Client
- ✅ Transactions
- ✅ Budgets
- ✅ Projects (when developed)
- ✅ Tasks (when developed)
- ✅ Vendors
- ✅ Categories
- ✅ Reports

**PWA/Mobile Support:**
- Account balances, projects, upcoming bills, exchange rates
- Communication to SLP (requests, status updates)
- Maintenance worker tasks

**Key Differences from Associations:**
| Aspect | Association | Single Unit |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Dues | Fixed annual schedule | On-demand "burn down" |
| Users | Multiple unit owners | Single owner (with multiple properties) |
| Navigation | Switch Clients (admin) | Switch Units (owner) |
| Reporting | Per unit + association rollup | Per property + owner rollup |

**Pilot Client: SLP (Sandyland Properties)**
Perfect test case with two distinct scenarios:
- **Aventuras Club Marina 102** - Condo in building SLP does NOT manage
- **MTC PH4D** - Condo within MTC client (SLP does manage building)

This tests both standalone and "nested" single-unit scenarios.

**Rental Tracking (Future Phase - 2026):**
- Dates, names, amounts, contracts
- Currently handled via Google Sheets + Forms + Web App
- Will be phased into this enhancement when further defined
- Not blocking initial single-unit implementation

**Implementation Phases (Proposed):**
1. **Analysis:** Presentation layer changes, filter patterns
2. **Client Configuration:** Add "single-unit" flag to client config
3. **Navigation:** Switch Units UI pattern for owners
4. **On-Demand Billing:** "Burn down" funding model display
5. **PWA Integration:** Owner dashboard for single units
6. **Pilot:** Create SLP client with ACM-102 and MTC-PH4D
7. **Rental Tracking:** Phase 2 - detailed requirements TBD 2026

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Core platform stable (achieved)
- ✅ Budget Module (v0.4.0)
- ✅ Projects Module (v0.4.2)
- 📋 Tasks/Calendar system (prerequisite)
- 📋 Additional Reports (prerequisite)
- 📋 Production go-live complete
