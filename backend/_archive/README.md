# Archived Backend Code - DO NOT USE

This directory contains orphaned/deprecated backend code that is NO LONGER IN USE.

## Why This Exists:
- Historical reference for API patterns
- Duplicate route files that were never properly consolidated
- Awaiting complete removal after stability confirmation

## For AI Agents:
**NEVER use code from this directory. Always use active modules listed in ACTIVE_MODULES.md**

## What's Archived Here:
- `/routes/` - Duplicate or unused route files

## Important:
For current API implementations:
1. Check ACTIVE_MODULES.md for active route files
2. Verify which routes are actually mounted in the Express app
3. Never assume a route file is active just because it exists
