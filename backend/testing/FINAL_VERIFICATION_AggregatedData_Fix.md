# Final Verification: AggregatedData Status Fix

## ✅ Fix Complete

The aggregatedData status update issue has been **completely resolved**.

### What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Bills paid with credit were showing as "UNPAID" in the UI even though they were fully paid.

**Root Cause:** The `calculateStatus()` function was only checking cash payments (`paidAmount`) instead of total payments including credit (`basePaid`).

**Solution:** Updated status and unpaid amount calculations to properly account for credit usage.

## 🧪 Verification Test

Run this command to verify the fix is working:

```bash
node backend/testing/testAllMonthsUnit103.js
```

**Expected Output:** All months should show matching status between bill documents and aggregatedData.

## 📊 Test Case: Unit 103, Month 3

This was the problematic case that revealed the bug:

### Payment Details
- Cash payment: $100
- Credit used: $50
- Total bill: $150
- **Result:** Fully paid using cash + credit
