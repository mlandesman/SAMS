- **Result**: Successfully returned 2024 year-end balances
- **Fix Applied**: Removed active flag check for historical snapshots
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "cashBalance": 500000,      // Now correctly calculated
    "bankBalance": 9428666,     // Now correctly calculated
    "accounts": [
      {
        "name": "MTC Bank",

  }
}
```

### ✅ Test 3: POST /api/clients/:clientId/balances/recalculate
- **Status**: PASSED (Fixed)
- **Response Time**: 1057ms
- **Purpose**: Recalculate balances from year-end snapshot
- **Result**: Successfully recalculated and saved balances
- **Fix Applied**: Implemented full logic instead of request forwarding
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "cashBalance": 6298000,
    "bankBalance": 25863459,
    "totalBalance": 32161459,
    "processedTransactions": 153,
    "sourceSnapshot": "2024-12-31",
    "dryRun": false
  }
}
```

### ✅ Test 4: POST /api/clients/:clientId/balances/year-end-close/:year
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Response Time**: 1072ms (includes GET current balances)
- **Purpose**: Create new year-end snapshot
- **Result**: Successfully created 2025 year-end snapshot
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Year-end snapshot for 2025 created successfully",
    "snapshotDate": "2025-12-31",
    "accountCount": 2
  }
}
```

### ✅ Test 5: GET /api/clients/:clientId/balances/recalculate (Legacy)
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Response Time**: 763ms
- **Purpose**: Test backward compatibility with GET endpoint
- **Result**: Legacy endpoint continues to work with dry run
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "cashBalance": 6298000,
    "bankBalance": 25863459,
    "totalBalance": 32161459,
    "processedTransactions": 153,
    "sourceSnapshot": "2024-12-31",
    "dryRun": true
  }
}
```

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Year-End Balance Totals (Fixed)
- **Issue**: Cash and bank totals showed as 0 for historical snapshots
- **Fix**: Removed `active !== false` check for snapshot accounts since they're historical records
- **Result**: Totals now correctly calculate from snapshot data

### 2. POST Recalculate Authentication (Fixed)
- **Issue**: 401 "Invalid token format" errors
- **Fix**: Implemented full recalculation logic in POST endpoint instead of trying to forward to GET
- **Result**: POST endpoint now works correctly with proper authentication

### 3. Transaction Validation (Improved)
- **Issue**: System could infer account types from user-entered strings
- **Fix**: Removed accountId inference; now requires explicit accountType field
- **Result**: Better data integrity with clear error messages for missing accountType

## Security & Validation

All endpoints properly implement:
- ✅ Authentication middleware (`authenticateUserWithProfile`)
- ✅ Client access control (`enforceClientAccess`)
- ✅ Permission checks (`requirePermission`)
- ✅ Security event logging (`logSecurityEvent`)
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend implementation complete
2. ✅ All endpoints tested and working
3. ⏳ Update frontend utilities to use new APIs
4. ⏳ Remove Firebase SDK imports from balance files
5. ⏳ Integration testing with TransactionsView
6. ⏳ Deploy to staging environment

## Conclusion

All balance API endpoints are successfully implemented and tested:
- GET /current - Working
- GET /year-end/:year - Working (with fix)
- POST /recalculate - Working (with fix)
- POST /year-end-close/:year - Working
- GET /recalculate (legacy) - Working for backward compatibility

The backend is ready for frontend integration.
