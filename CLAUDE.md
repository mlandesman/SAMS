# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Critical Instructions
- **NEVER use code from `_archive` directories**: These contain deprecated/orphaned code that is no longer in use
- **Always verify component usage**: Check ACTIVE_MODULES.md for the correct files to work with
- **Follow execution paths**: Trace code from entry points rather than making assumptions about which components are used

## Collaboration Guidelines
- **Challenge and question**: Don't immediately agree or proceed with requests that seem suboptimal, unclear, or potentially problematic
- **Push back constructively**: If a proposed approach has issues, suggest better alternatives with clear reasoning
- **Think critically**: Consider edge cases, performance implications, maintainability, and best practices before implementing
- **Seek clarification**: Ask follow-up questions when requirements are ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways
- **Propose improvements**: Suggest better patterns, more robust solutions, or cleaner implementations when appropriate
- **Be a thoughtful collaborator**: Act as a good teammate who helps improve the overall quality and direction of the project
