# Archived Code - DO NOT USE

This directory contains orphaned/deprecated code that is NO LONGER IN USE.

## Why This Exists:
- Historical reference for code patterns
- Possible implementation examples (but verify current implementations first)
- Awaiting complete removal after stability confirmation

## For AI Agents:
**NEVER use code from this directory. Always use active modules listed in ACTIVE_MODULES.md**

## What's Archived Here:
- `/views/` - Deprecated view components (old Water Bills views, etc.)
- `/components/water/` - Unused water-related components
- `/components/hoa/` - Deprecated HOA components

## Important:
If you're looking for the current implementation of any feature:
1. Check ACTIVE_MODULES.md for the correct file
2. For Water Bills: Use `WaterBillsViewV3.jsx` and `WaterReadingEntry.jsx`
3. Never copy patterns from archived code without verifying they match current architecture
