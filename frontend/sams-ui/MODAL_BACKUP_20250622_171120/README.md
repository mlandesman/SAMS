# Sophisticated Transaction Confirmation Modal Backup

**Created:** June 22, 2025
**Purpose:** Preserve working professional modal with document viewer integration

## What's Working
- ✅ Professional PWA-style design with green gradient header
- ✅ Transaction ID prominently displayed
- ✅ Icons for each field (Amount, Date, Category, etc.)
- ✅ Clickable document names that open DocumentViewer
- ✅ Modal appears AFTER transaction save (not before)
- ✅ File upload system completely untouched and working
- ✅ Mobile responsive design

## Key Files
1. **TransactionConfirmationModal.jsx** - Main component with professional layout
2. **TransactionConfirmationModal.css** - Complete professional styling
3. **TransactionsView.jsx** - Integration handler (lines 1153-1210)

## To Restore
Simply copy these files back to their original locations:
- TransactionConfirmationModal.jsx → src/components/
- TransactionConfirmationModal.css → src/components/  
- TransactionsView.jsx → src/views/

## Integration Points
- Modal triggered in TransactionsView.jsx onSubmit handler (line 1204)
- Uses existing working file upload system
- Shows AFTER transaction save with real transaction ID
- Documents are clickable and open DocumentViewer

This backup preserves the sophisticated confirmation modal that was working
on June 22, 2025 before any further modifications.
